How many of those who received help during self quarantine turned into volunteers ? I don’t have the stats but I know many cases. We have one today. L finished his 2week quarantine and changed his WeChat name to “Volunteer L”. Thank you and welcome VL. #Grateful  #COVID19  #Yeg pic.twitter.com/S0IF6SUQN4

Practice good health habits: wash hands for at least 20 secs w/ soap, cover your mouth when you cough, and if you have symptoms of #COVID19  STAY HOME (do NOT go to school or work) and immediately contact your healthcare provider. If you don’t have/can’t afford a doctor, call 211.

Drive thru staff handle cash then your food products anyways with no glove changing or hand washing in between. Roll up cups should be the least of their health worries...

Cash is covered in bodily fluids, germs, bacteria etc. If their reasoning is for health safety then by that logic they shouldn't be accepting cash either.

I agree viruses can come back on winning cups... but my point is by this logic they should not be accepting cash either, especially not handling cash and food products without hand washing.

Also, time is running out. I love Tulsi but I just can't see her winning the primaries at this rate. 

Bernie has been resistant of Yang's policies. All that's left is Biden.
-7
BackstreetLamb
2020-03-11 11:33:50
Bernie also supported warmongering Hillary in 2016. Also, Bernie had a heart attack. 

We all know Biden's gonna win. And Yang also said that's he endorses Biden based on the probability of him winning. Which is getting clearer by the day.
-7
BackstreetLamb
2020-03-11 14:33:55
We also have to look at the probability of who's gonna win. I love Tulsi to the moon & back but she's not gonna win the primaries. Bernie's policies are way too far left. Yang's endorsing Biden based on him having the highest probability of winning. He took the utilitarian route.

The only thing that can stop Trump now is the coronavirus. If the number of coronavirus cases increase in the US, the economy will slow down. Biden will then have a higher chance of winning.

Like it or not, that's the reality.

In general everyone has to place priority of health and avoidance if possible. In the coming weeks I'm do self isolation (just did 7 days) until today. Follow WHO guidelines for safety and main thing is do everything possible to avoid contact with others. Use common sense (1/?)
-7
RaymondUpenieks
2020-03-16 08:04:43
(2/2) Variables for everyone, immune system and overall health. Age is a factor but - if a person is healthy the risks are always reduced. If you can self quarantine/isolate since the key is avoidance. This will pass but it will take time. I'm going back into self isolation..
-7
RaymondUpenieks
2020-03-16 08:08:12
But keep distance from people and avoid gatherings of people. If you can stay at home, do it. Virus can hurt you if your not exposed to it. But COVID19 is fast spreading so stay safe and the most important thing in life is health.

I fully admit to taking joy in this. 

In fact, I'm hoping for it, as long as we're getting a flu pandemic made much worse by trump's aggressive incompetence.

It's not like it hasn't happened before. Woodrow Wilson caught the Spanish flu in 1918.

2020-03-08 11:59:22
Deliberate misinterpretation is bad box office.

I didn't say I take joy in Wilson having caught the Spanish flu, or the Spanish flu epidemic.

But if there's 1 person alive today who deserves to get covid-19 and suffer along with everybody else it's trump.
I'll applaud it.

I do. I'm hoping the school will ease up and let us borrow one. They set up Google classrooms and they have some reading and math apps the kids use at school, we just need laptops. I hope the teachers can stay involved as well and stay with the curriculum.

"But special problems start when women step out of the still-feminized realm of teaching children and start sharing their expertise with adults — in universities or in the wider public." PREACH.

I hate this (ubiquitous attitude) for many reasons, chiefly that we were all children who became adults & within all of us, particularly at times of stress, that child still exists. And we're all kind of making this grown up stuff up as we go along.

For certain ppl - i.e. the vulnerable - i.e. those the government are telling to self-isolate, regardless, staying in such close proximity to family (or completely alone) is dangerous to their physical/mental/emotional health. More so than #CoronaVirus . #COVID_19uk  #Covid_19

Locked in the sharp claws of a raging #panicattack , going on 4 1/2 hours now. Shaking, rapid cycling, head spinning. 

My mental health drastically spirals downward when I am physically ill. I also tend to ruminate like I have blinders on to anything else.

However, your 3rd comedian last night - can we not tell free lunch and molestation jokes in 2020 please? Poor taste and many left the theater just minutes into his set.

It's about us, and how we respond to all of this. And it's about hope.

I'm not saying that listening to 'On Circles' by @Caspian  will inoculate you from a virus.

But it might just inoculate you from losing hope. Or from emotional detachment. Or from fear & anxiety. (If only for 46 minutes.)

You deserve it.

Just left NYC and they’ve got a big team going around and testing the homeless, helping them with any risks they might encounter. Before we had left they had approached a couple thousand people. Not all were tested but those at risk I think.

As much as I hated chinese lessons when I was a teen. I'm glad I learn mandarin chinese now. The language is still a pain in the ass & has 5000+ strokes in the alphabet system. But this is an extremely essential skill that I want my kids to learn.

Saying NO to things that I know will not serve my peace of mind, stress level or bank account has been important in 2020. Last year I said yes to everything even when my gut told me no and my health suffered for it. That’s done.

It’s also why a sunset or a walk in the woods can be an immense source of joy #ActuallyAutistic https:// twitter.com/autistictic/st atus/1238004526294106112   …

I hope one day we get a journalist brave enough to report every Trump related crime & origin story to today

With every dirty truth & every lie exposed

And I wish every newspaper, magazine, blog..whatever.. all publish the same exact story

An emotional gambit with low odds of success. By leaving Trump in power longer you risk further erosion of the system that you hope can elect a progressive candidate in the future. Again, you have to change minds for the movement to succeed.

The saddest part of the whole situation is now every single person who is a stagehand, audio tech, video tech, production-tech, CARPS labourer, spotlight sniper, backline, wardrobe, seamstresses, roadie, TM, security guard, all have lost their jobs now. 

We’re all affected.

The National guard really helped our area clean up after April 27,2011 tornado's that hit Alabama. They came in and kept the looters out, and help clear the rubble. They can be really great at helping keep order if we work with them.

I placed an order through Walmart Groceries. I do not have a car & not being of the best health staying out of the public is a must. I couldn't get half my order. I didn't get my toilet paper, bottle water, or hand soap. Others #panicbuying  is keeping me from necessities.

Can @CyrilRamaphosa  please ask the medical community to allocate specific GP's in cities, to solely take in people who want to test for #COVID19  cuz it's not a nice feeling waiting outside an office

Most French political parties are saying the same today coming out of a meeting with the government: no clear answer for an emergency plan to support our health system, only decisions about emergency plan for the economy. This is the France of Macron. Money > People.

It worries me that there are Christians out there that view the sharing of resources, and putting others before ourselves as a "socialist" concept. God is for us, not JUST YOU. God isn't liberal or conservative; He isn't driven by greed. He is driven by LOVE. We need that now.

I see a lot of speculation or expectation of #covid19  stopping or slowing its spread with the arrival of warmer weather.

As long as we are forced to do this, we -humans on this planet- might as well change in ways that do not just save our own hides, but the long-term health of the planet as well.

For older generations in particular, it's pretty much the least we can do.

The crona virus has made us realise one thing. All the elite classes are on holidays- The CEO,filmstars,cricketers. The ones working are ward boys, watchmen, sweepers because if they stop working the city will come to a standstill. Next time treat this people with more respect.

Reason? I asked him to wash his hands and not touch what I’ve disinfected until he did. I have emphysema so I am trying to be extra cautious. 
I think I should self-isolate in a nice hotel

Shocked to learn that the car dealership @lexus  of #beverlyhills  is keeping its sales dept. open when all #non -essential businesses in #California  are supposed to be closed. Do they not care about safety of customers & staff?? #Covid_19  #SaferAtHome  #StayTheFHome

Yes. As White people we all need to be watching out for the safety of Asian-Americans - and for the well-being of our Black brothers and sisters, amid justified fears of how various quarantine restrictions might be enforced #COVID19  #SaferAtHome  #Quarantine https:// twitter.com/traceyecorder/ status/1240827139470942208   …

That's worse than the Great Depression, which was about 25% unemployment and 30% drop in GDP.  But Great Depression was causing by economic failure and this is medical/health related so not sure how equal the comparison can be.

@ kathygriffin  So sorry about your mom. I have been thinking about her a lot lately since you kindly gave us a heads up a while back about her declining health

To honor her memory, I will read her book while drinking box wine

Bless her for birthing and raising you

You're great!

Yeah, hope your daughter stays healthy. That is scary. I'm going to make some masks in my spare time. The tweet with the pattern is on my feed from about midnight. I haven't sewed in decades, but I thought it was something I could do to help the situation for somebody. Take care

So true

Things will be shaken up

Never to be done the same again

Crisis brings out the best

& the worst in people

WWII=women in the workplace

COVID-19=working from home

Extended families may live together again

Due to economics & health issues

trumpism is dead & gone!

So... the Anuak people in South Sudan were founded by a man called Chuwai who married his sister; produced two children( a boy & a girl), and their children in turn married themselves...and boom the Anuak tribe is founded? What? Oral history is that you?

it's a good first step, but he's got a history of flipping back to being really conservative on stuff.  But in all fairness, the ACA was mostly modeled on his healthcare law in MA, so he's softer on health than most GOP.

It overlapped end of WWI, with a gazillion soldiers returning sick or grievously injured from a war of unprecedented brutality.

Interesting to hear that faithful dispensation (permission to miss you Sunday obligation) has been granted by the Ottawa archbishop. #StayHomeSaveLives  #COVIDCanada  

I hope this is happening across the world, does anyone know?

for people who want to practice but are unable for health issues (hospitalized/too sick to travel) and for people with busy lives and schedules it would allow them to participate in mass "on the go" or so they can regularly attend the same person/preacher/pastor

Fully isolating for a month, as my chronic illnesses aren’t immune-friendly. Since he still has to go in to work, Branden’s been sleeping on the couch & making all grocery/pharmacy runs to make sure I’m as safe as possible. This is what partnership looks like, & I’m so thankful. pic.twitter.com/YFNQFDBZUh

That’s an official lockdown in the UK more or less. It’s about time. Hope the idiots who continued to go out causing trouble and shop when there was no need to are proud of themselves. For the next 3 weeks, the nation’s going to be under 24 hour surveillance. #COVIDー19

I see Kim Kardashian is trending. Glad that everyone has realised how much of a liar she is. She knew her and Kanye didn’t tell the truth about Taylor yet continued to bullshit. She is scum and so is her husband. #KimKardashianIsOverParty

I do feel like, after this is over and done, there will be a big economic boom because people will be so anxious to get out and mingle, shop, go have a drink with friends, etc. I hope we can be patient and look beyond the current calamity. It’s not easy, but I have faith.

I’m sorry. I’m just now hearing that some of the WA restrictions don’t apply to our county. My next work day is Wednesday. I really kinda hope I don’t have to go, but I can afford to do that for a little while. Stay safe, warm, hydrated. I’m sending you good vibes

Joe Biden’s biggest mistake tonight was entering a debate with Bernie Sanders alone. Bernie is exposing Joe Biden on his Bankruptcy Bill, his support of cutting Social Security, and his supporting of bailing out the banks after the financial crisis.  #DemDebate

Joe Biden is a Status Quo politician: his policies change based on what is popular and what will get him elected.

Be that gay marriage, abortion rights, or social security.

A leader leads by example, not by following the crowd.

Hannah, thank you for sharing this. The other thing that this attitude disregards is that by not implementing strong measures to limit transmission, it becomes more likely that those at risk will be infected by those with mild cases.

Why not plan for the worst and hope for the best? And prioritize people's lives over economic growth? I'm disappointed in airlines (@AlaskaAir ) encouraging people to continue traveling during this time of uncertainty. Delaying non-essential trips would help flatten the curve.

I sure hope Jojo feels better soon! It’s gut wrenching when our fur babies are ill and we’re left unsure of what’s going on or how to help. 

Maybe there is juuuust a wee bit of material stuck in Jojo’s intestinal tract that Doc initially overlooked. Worth another looksee

Welcome move, but an average wide body aircraft has over 250 seats/passengers. 

I am afraid, 182 rooms will fill up in less than a day. 

All Aerocity hotels must be made available immediately as the area can be secured easily.

What about the health of the hotel staff?

Following a couple vivid nightmares about this terrible virus I was jolted awake, early. Listening to the birdsong of the outside & looking forward to the sunshine later. Watching "Broadchurch" on #Netflix  as I start to slowly wake up now that my fear level has come to normal.

Don't think primary doctor was "fully awake" at 8:30 this morning. He scooted back from the table & his tablet a bit too fast. He FELL OFF the rolly stool, busted his ass on the floor, hit his head on the wall. And all I could do was bust out laughing.

I am so cold presently.   Mother Nature needs to turn the sun back on. The way it's looking outside the sunshine isn't going to make its appearance today as they claim it would. Gray and cloudy, very cloudy. Dull and damp, extremely damp. Makes the coldness chill to the bone.

1/2 However, general tips: 

Clarity of expectations -- this reduces anxiety. Children need to know what to expect. For us, this means a schedule. BUT, I am flexible w/it in reality.

Get outside - short walks or backyard play if at all possible really helps
3
IndieJenFischer
2020-03-17 03:53:58
Last tip -- probably the most essential for us: 

Daily Quiet Time. This is a requirement in our house. They must lie down without reading, talking, etc. for 15 minutes. EVERYDAY (beginning Friday) that we've done this, my children (8 and 10 well past nap age) have fallen asleep!

Please implement emergency financial measures to ensure small businesses survive the crisis. Please give the people the income they are losing so they don't also lose their homes. It's crucial that we not only protect our health, but also our finances.

Then, shelter in place.

I have the same concerns. I don't think we are over reacting health wise, but as we are responding we are creating an economic crisis and doing almost nothing to curb that. We are running the world into financial recession, if not depression. It's truly terrifying on all fronts.

I went out today to run all the errands I needed to for weeks

Stocked up at Walmart 

There is one elderly worker

He never smiles & is slow 

Poor thing, exposed to all the diseases

I gave him $5 & said THANK YOU! Take yourself to lunch

He tried to give it back

He smiled!!!!

# COVID19  #PSA  If you are fortunate enough to have been tested and have negative results, it doesn't mean you're off the hook.  Media makes it appear that you're good to go if NEG. You're not INOCULATED, you can still catch it later.  Be safe, practice good hygiene and distancing!

Make sure auto pickup is on. Things you need (weapons, health etc) will be highlighted in yellow and will auto pick up if you have space. Other things have to tap on.

You don't have pants because you earn and buy outfits as you progress through the game.

Our suspension of disbelief ended when the World Health Organization epidemiologist doctor went to Hong Kong to study the deadly, unknown virus, and SHOOK A DUDES HAND in the airport and didn't immediately bleach her hand. NOPE NOT BUYING IT.

What it means if L.A. also mandates #shelter  in place:

You can leave home only
1. in emergencies
2. if you work in health care, grocery stores, pharmacy
3. to shop at grocery stores or pharmacies
4. to walk your dog 
5. to run, bike, walk

4.+5. require 6 ft betw you and others

And that a government spokesperson failed to condemn this when afforded the opportunity shows that they are simply not taking things seriously as they should be. It still seems economic concerns and looking after their financial donors are outweighing the health ones.

I texted an elderly neighbour today. She was so thankful and appreciated the kind gesture. Let’s remember that in these dark times. It costs nothing, and takes very little time to check in on those around you. Kindness goes a long way when the world has been turned upside down.

Thank you! My great grandmother walked from Nebraska to Oregon when she was just 5 years old. I’m really lucky to have know her.  

Her mom died shortly after arriving in Oregon & was buried in a church yard  near in Storrs, OR. Her mom’s grave now sits under a road.

Super fun #COVID19  scenario- a thread.  Hubs has a fever (3 days straight). Call the Health Dept. After 45 mins wait on hold (Day 2), had to hang up for a conference call. No PCP seem to be taking new pt's now either.  Meanwhile me and all 3 kids are avoiding him.
4
AllyNeedsANap
2020-03-18 02:43:17
We don't have a PCP bc we just have let it slide.  Keeping 3 kids and 4 animals properly cared for has caused us to put ourselves on the "we'll get to it" list.  So I call the Urgent Care. No need for the ER. We aren't there yet. UC says call the Health Dept. *ugh right*
4
AllyNeedsANap
2020-03-18 02:43:17
Bc the UC doesn't even have testing capabilities and she heard there is a drive thru test set up (there is not, it is still in the works). So she gives me yet another phone number. I call it. Hey it's the Health Dept again. But I get a person this time! Tell her about Hub's
4
AllyNeedsANap
2020-03-18 02:43:18
So that's where we are.  Can't get a test anywhere but a dr office/healthdept/er. Ok cool. Can't get into a dr office. Health Dept is probably going to say no bc he doesn't meet their higher criteria. ER is for critical cases, of which he is not. Crazy right?

Reality - Guy whom I knew since 1st grade is dying, he has stage 4 cancer & is terminal. He needs 2 pints of blood.

Due to the blood shortage they're skipping over him because of his health, & giving blood to someone who is healthy at the risk of his life.

If you liked Children of Men or the adaptation of The Road, then Light of My Life (on @PrimeVideo ) is essential. Similar premise, but a more intimate focus.

Truly extraordinary, from the opening scene to the final perfect image. A bruising performance by Affleck.

Can't say for certain, but I very much doubt it. I'm in Quarantine after travelling back to China. I've been tested twice. It's unlikely they would test me twice and not test people with symptoms.  Also, don't trust HK news about mainland China, it's rarely subjective or true

I agree. 6 mths is ridiculous, if people still going to work, children still playing together, and people still congregating together for whatever reason. It will go a lot longer than 6 mths. One day, the police & military will enforce a stay-at-home. Just a matter of when.

The PM is right to toughen the rules. The tougher the better. EVERYBODY stay home and don’t leave, enforceable everywhere, is the only hope. BUT, if he isn’t prepared to send in the military, and the states aren’t prepared to use their police, people won’t comply #COVID19Aus

Men also enjoy the “I just printed it!” $100 bill joke, “wanna clean my house too?” If they enter the store while I’m vacuuming, and some even try that yank of the dollar bill like grandpa used to do, laughing because I can’t grab it. These “jokes” are boring and old

It's also a nice change of pace after The Bad Batch's action-heavy storyline. #TheCloneWars  #StarWars pic.twitter.com/LQhcVbfqvp

I understand doctors are at forefront of this war just as security ppl tackling it on road or own domain. Bt this is too much. Focus on job. Enf of salutes nd guard of honour. Otherwise do for all security ppl, health workers, guy sitting in bank or telco. #coronavirusinpakistan

Quarantine Day 6: I just realized I’ve spent more time outside (for mental health walks, while staying 6 ft apart) in the past 6 days than I ever would during a normal work week. I guess that’s a positive? #QuarantineLife

First of all that 60 million was not the popular vote, but the electoral vote as I heard. I searched it up myself as well. Overall, the issue is that Biden has no chance of winning without us. Trump just got a 47% approval rating for the Coronavirus from @PpollingNumbers .

No, you don’t need to go to that bar or pub. Just like you don’t NEED to drink at all. 

You NEED to #staythefuckhome  and then, once this does eventually end, go to a goddamn meeting.

Prioritizing booze over personal & public safety is a telltale sign that you’re an alcoholic.

Thanks matey. Willing ourselves to get over it. I’d sleep all day but I can’t because of the children. The fact that they don’t seem very affected (when they normally get stuff worse than us) and we feel awful suggests that this is what it is.

Flying isn’t an ‘option’ for me. I use it to work. I’m grateful to fly, I’m also annoyed by the gouging. The next time you or someone in your family has to fly last minute out of necessity, I hope you remember this conversation and your statement ‘airlines don’t gouge’.

Just being in the sun & around trees/nature/wildlife will help immensely. Your doc may say you can go 2 park or walk down street, too. Don’t take my word, definitely get that from the doc, but I hope it’s the same for you. Try to get 30 minutes of sun each day 2 keep Vit D up:)

Pls read the article. These chemicals have nothing 2 do w/health care. The EPA is pushing pesticides & new forms of non-stick chemicals into the market without proper vetting. This problem is longstanding and will endanger human health not help.

2020-03-19 06:37:28
Please clarify that this has nothing to do with chemicals that will help humans or health care. Very misleading title which will lead people to believe these fast-track chemicals would be useful during our current health crisis.

Good luck with it. I'm in Quarantine, in China, having returned here on Tuesday last. If I go outside, I could be facing 3 years in prison, my wife had to move to another apartment so I could be alone, or she would also be quarantined - now that's how it should be done. I approve

I think the US have enough problems of their own now - it's up to Europe to help themselves, China is helping too - but I don't think many Americans will know that, or be grateful for it, they have several thousand new cases a day and haven't even started testing properly yet

Okay, to compromise, we can move Echo to the Support category, make Focusing Beam a healing move instead (that heals more for teammates under 50 percent hp), and we're done. :D

But I don't mind her as DPS too. :) #Overwatch

I needed some beauty, connections and contemplation today. So I called some friends while weeding and enjoyed the blooms around the house.

Grandma went into the hospital yesterday. Nurses say they lock the door when they leave. No visitors.

Today, Spicejet is in a dire situation and yet:

2. Their only hope is government bailouts/concessions.

It’s been a pleasure, man. I’m grateful I got to briefly meet you & your lovely wife once. And I’m deeply grateful for your music. It’s forever altered my mental landscape. I’ve been revisiting your early work, and it holds up! All the way back to “Stars in the Rearview Mirror.”

Here's my hot take of the day:

I have no problem with celebrities singing "Imagine," a call for (among other things) thoughtful living and world peace.

Zero. Problem. At. All.

#Imagine

I'll likely get torched for this, but I really think it would be best if we didn't normalize day drinking. We're at the *very* beginning of this crisis and it will spiral into a mental health (& domestic abuse) crisis if everyone is pounding beers in the morning. Just a thought.

#3  Maybe They Will... (if you dig @StarsOfTheLid )
#2  Departure Songs (ambitious, epic, 19 songs!)
#1  Mysterium (elegiac, profound, aching)

Let’s hope this can been resolved for the sake of our frontline workers. It seems the NHS England is ahead of the curve and maybe at times of such crisis the devolution project must not become a barrier for joined up thinking and delivery of the care and services we need.

It's an approach to ignore the short-term effects (many deaths, overload on the medical system) in the hope that the long-term benefit will be that everyone remaining will build up immunity in case it strikes again.   It is not the best approach as front loads the seriously ill.

When receiving packages, they could contain traces of the virus no matter how carefully they have been packed and handled.

Facts are that the gap between the rich & the poor is widening, Food poverty, child poverty, zero hr. contracts.
A Capitalist growth model cannot be sustained by the planet. We need a new way.
We must live in harmony with our planet, Covid-19, extreme weather is just the start

I’m 39 weeks preg and was told to self isolate from Tues by my midwife and the government. My partner was instantly sent home from his work. Granted he’s predominantly office based but was given all resources needed to work from home on full pay. Hope Sainsburies sort this ASAP!

Sana mapadali ang paglabas ng budget para maka acquire ng maraming PPE for the frontliners, test kit, face mask, alcohol, and food for the less fortunate individuals.

At sana magtalaga ng isa or two hospitals to house all the positive patient in the PH. https://www. gmanetwork.com/news/news/nati on/730980/senate-passes-bill-giving-duterte-additional-powers-vs-covid-19/story/   …

Budget should be release as soonest possible to help in combating and treating #COVID2019  pandemic. The frontliners should be prioritized for their safety and convenience. Definitely, they are the unsung heroes in this time of pandemic outbreak.

That’s fortunate. I haven’t stockpiled anything. Bought a 12 pack of Andrew over a month ago and still have some rolls left, which is remarkable in itself as my reputation of a liberal use of loo roll is infamous.

He's not social distancing in fact he's being Mr. Goody helping his neighbors during the #COVID19  crisis. If I have to endure my trauma doing the right thing with isolation why should I have to worry he's bringing in the disease to me and my mother. He's risking our health.

2) I have really poor health and have multiple family members with poor health and there's a possibility we'll need to trade organs so I'd like to know

And you don'r need to be suicidal to have suicidal stuff. I haven't been suicidal in perhaps 5 years, but there are times I still have those tendencies, those jokes about offing myself or genuinely thinking "if I kill myself now, I don't have to do dishes"

We are under reacting, once covid19 hits the heartland of America and health systems fail we will see a massive spike. God help us if it gets into the detention system.

This is the ticking time bomb as many of these areas do not have adequate health facilities. Favelas, informal settlements, refugee and migrant camps could all be epicenters of COVID19 fatalities.

This is spot-on.

We must expand and massively re-tool our health care system. 

Right now.

It's crucial we build temp facilities, support HC professionals with all we have & ensure #covid19  tests, prevention, tx, etc are open to all on demand for free. https://www. washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-c oronavirus-pandemic-is-not-an-economic-crisis-its-a-health-care-crisis/2020/03/19/d7bb64a6-6a1a-11ea-abef-020f086a3fab_story.html   …

Current statistics in the United States show the highest number of hospitalizations for Corona Virus so far are for ages 20-55 ...
I would venture to guess because U.S. has higher numbers of health conditions in younger populations. A very real concern I haven't seen addressed.

I'm not afraid of sickness or death in general, never have been. I'm terrified of a painful lingering death for my own sake and those who love me. 

I crave the social isolation right now, for my mental health. Strange, but true.

Somewhat good news for O’Neills employees in Strabane as the sportswear company confirm it will move to manufacturing 50,000 scrubs for the Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland. 750 staff were laid off last week, but 150 will now be reemployed #COVIDー19

If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings

Other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship must also close immediately.

After failing to secure tests for the NHS Mark Drakeford last night told Adrian Masters on ITV Wales that they were dealing with a consortium to acquire them.

Absolutely re elderly people and anyone with mental health issues, isolation would be difficult in the best of times.

Apart from the odd walk/drive around, we’ve been completely isolated since Ryan started working from home 8 days ago, and social distancing/staying at home for 12 days. It’s been the best days we’ve ever spent together! The house has been so joyful and I’m fully loving life rn.

A chronic illness should never be a joke punchline. Diabetes isn’t funny, and even Type 2s are often caused by other pre-existing conditions and not a fully able bodied person having a bad diet. Jokes like this are why people assume people with diabetes “did it to themselves.”

Simple. The #hypocritenewsmedia  promote Biden non-stop and kisses his rear for whatever he does or says. Joy from MSNBC actually tweeted during the Sunday debate if a person's past record mattered? 

So yeah don't even trust the liberal media either. https:// twitter.com/YadzTy/status/ 1240838884994330626   …

It's silly to think that people still believe that it the #CoronavirusPandemic  be stopped and humanity will triumph as always. Should I remind everyone that the Great Depression lasted for a decade & the Dark Ages for almost a milenium? Mankind's worst enemy is his own creations.

(1/2) The COVID-19 pandemic is a wake up call to a new generation to step up & course correct. We invest trillions of dollars around the world on bombs, weapons, and instruments of violence & destruction but we barely have the instruments necessary to protect & heal each other.

Things I have learned in quarantine: 
1) If left to his own devices, my husband will exercise every day and shower once a week; whereas 
2) I will shower every day and exercise once a week.

Self isolation day 13 is now mandatory quarantine for 14 more days. 

Kids run this house now I'm merely just the butler. 

I appreciate small talk with strangers so much more now. 

Still holding onto that small sliver of hope summer is as planned.

Bottom line: Donald Trump is risking our lives for his own benefit. His lies will cripple us in more ways than we can imagine. This is why we need to vote him out in November. We cannot trust him. We never could. https:// youtu.be/s_ypH6Bk-oY

By “reason” I hope you mean “the universe is consistent and everything is connected”, then yes.  There is an explanation for things that happen.  If you mean “there is an underlying intent for everything and it’s all part of someone’s plan”, then fuck no.

He’s an anesthesiologist so he can afford the masks but what about nurses and other staff members of hospitals? Who’s supposed to take care of the people who take care of you? At this point, he hasn’t seen his children in two weeks and doesn’t know when he will be able to.

There are a whole lot of people who never recovered from 2008 who are now getting hit again. Only jobs have become weaker. The social safety net, which we outsourced to employers, vanished as businesses became "platforms" & workers became "independent contractors". https:// twitter.com/rooseveltinst/ status/1242192138236047363   …

I tuned into the Luck Family concert last week- a festival organized by Willie Nelson- & it felt like sitting around a visual radio. There was something really special about knowing that I was joining others around the country in a shared synchronous experience.

NYC has launched a "Medical Reserve Corps" aimed at health professionals, but this is an interesting idea. What are the essential tasks that someone with no medical education could quickly learn to perform?

"It's flexible!" they said. "You can control your own time!" they said. We can have a gig economy or we can have an employer-driven social safety net. We have both. That is a major problem.

Anyone else thoroughly grossed out by corporations opening their private stores of emergency medical supplies to generously donate to the general good? Like, why do corporations have private emergency bunker supplies to begin with? Have we privatized safety?

Since you—and 2 others, tops—are in your band(s), you have more control over your own diligence & safety (unlike, say, restaurant owners & employees). You could humerously encourage safety in your stage patter (3-6 feet, air kisses, elbow or fist bumps, no handshakes/hugging. 1/2

If people are too frightened to go to your shows, business will decrease  . If the show goes on, take care if yourself and really encourage crowd safety. I mean, safe sex worked during the AIDS crisis if people did what they were supposed to.

Well the tests really never did that.  It just measured wealth, the ability to overcome known biases, and access to prep 

Hopefully we will see some more test optional opportunities that are less restrictive in terms of GPA

It would be nice but I don't think @Amazon  or @AmazonHelp  doesn't have anywhere to explain the item is essential. I'm immunocompromised a care provider for 2 aging parents & I can't risk trying to find the item in town or wait until it ships a month from now. So distraught.

I don’t know yet if anyone has gotten hurt. I hope not! In the midst of a pandemic, in a situation already of panic, fear and insecurity, this is the worst time to deal with such an earthquake and its consequences.

His lack of education is astounding in general given the schools he “graduated” from, but for a US president it’s almost comical. It’s it wasn’t so incredibly sad, I’d be laughing. I genuinely fear for our safety right now with talks of trying to have churches open Easter.

This is absurd, @IAGovernor  & @IAPublicHealth ! You don't have data cuz 1.) It's taking a week for test results & 2.) VERY FEW ppl are being tested. Plus, other state & global data should be plenty.

AGAIN, @IAGovernor  & @IAPublicHealth , during a global pandemic w/ the data/devastation happening in other states & countries + safety/capacity of healthcare system, you don't WAIT until you "NEED" it. You do it BEFORE we get to that point. Not enough tests to show IA #'s.

#54 in the Quarantine-A-Thon: THE OMEN (1976), swinging back around to religious horror joints. I love the church choir Latin jawn throughout, Gregory Peck also delivers the distraught dad who’s kid is the antichrist.

Few religious (Christianity) horror films that rock (no order):
1. The Omen 1-3
2. The Exorcist 1 and 3 (I also enjoyed the newer ones)
3. The Frailty 
4. Seventh Sign
5. Apostle
6. Carrie
7. Children of the Corn

I, and every man in my family over 30, have high blood pressure. It's nuts. I think they just still haven't internalized the effect their half-thought-out policies would have. I really hope Trump gets reined in.

Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a standardized, universal healthcare system that would take care of all the people rather than just the ones with money?  

Oh yeah, I remember when Obama tried to do that and was crushed by the @GOP  as wanting socialized medicine.

It's thundering, a storm whipping through the area. And I feel more at peace than I have in ages. As a child, I struggled with things I couldn't control. Heck, I still do. 

But, I would sit cross-legged in front of the glass storm door and just breathe in the storm. Peace.

It went through (?) a tree and the shell split into fragments....so entry wound was small ... But it was 30-06 rifle and thankfully hit a tree first. They found wood fragments during surgery to remove what they could and it came within 1/4 inch of heart/lungs. He was lucky..

The fear and worry is probably the second wave. This never had to happen and a failure if so many people and agencies. Countries that have excellent health care got hit hard and the near future, unpredictable. But the WHO should have called this months ago. People saw it coming.

Deaths coming from the need to focus on virus victims & ignore other emergencies should be counted

Nothing but death & destruction

To our once great country

9. Welcome the idea of having a 'Site Rep' on your set. Normally it's the owner or someone who knows the facility. They'll be able to answer all the questions and control some of the difficult machines around if needed. Might need to take down something only the owner would know. pic.twitter.com/l6ZeYxXTzz

In fact, if any parent feels lost, I will talk them through it.  Maybe I need to do like a zoom conference if there are a lot of parents but I am a tutor who went for 3 degrees.  I am not tutoring because of coronavirus. I would love to get back to helping and giving back

There is ALWAYS something to write in a gratitude journal...(if you don’t have one, get one! Notebooks are perfect!) When we are forced into uncertainty it is natural to think of what all could go wrong or how…  https://www. instagram.com/p/B-PfQF6ASlA/ ?igshid=1x67dhnxck82f   …

Most Americans are not afraid. In fact, states are complaining that people won’t follow “stay at home” orders.

CDC statistics show COVID-19 is not a threat to people under age 45 who don’t vape, smoke or have serious health conditions.

And some, if not many, parents are going to be more stressed and less available to their children. It’s a wide range of needs that teachers are asked to meet. Maybe flexibility and grace need to be at the core of every assignment/assessment.

7. Make a plan. Call your doctor, and any other specialists you may have, to find out what their protocols are. Call local health facilities to find out their plans, as well. It’s better to be prepared than to be frantic in an urgent moment. Stay calm! Write it all down.

8. For elderly patients, make a list of medications and health conditions they have. Put it somewhere that can be accessed swiftly in case of an emergency. Keep elderly patients home as much as possible. Check on your neighbors. Find out about telehealth for them.

11. Lastly, don’t neglect your mental health. Watch some funny videos, your favorite show or movie, talk to someone who can help you get through these tough times. Stay connected, even when you’re not allowed out. (I’m always here to talk!)

The crucial thing is that the hospitals here in Japan don't seem to be overwhelmed.  It is a mystery to everyone how we have so few cases but something we should be thankful for.  Cruise ships were banned immediately after DP.

Those are the professionals: reporting about it, diagnosing it, studying pandemic patterns, assigning billions of dollars to help people affected by it

Yet, they are setting a very bad example & putting their lives in danger

On a more serious note:

Magkaiba ang "NAMATAY para sa Bayan" sa "NAMATAY dahil sa walang KAHANDAAN".

Iba yung "YOU DIED FOR YOUR COUNTRY" sa "YOU DIED BECAUSE OF YOUR COUNTRY".

It's like telling your army to go to war, without a gun. Tapos you'll call them lucky for dying.

We are too. I'm lucky to live on a small town (about 35000) but pretty close to London. We aren't regular pub goers so other than working from home, kids off school, not being able to see mum and supermarket being a nightmare we haven't noticed the lockdown yet!

If the only recourse we have is Twitter, we’re all dead! This country my Dad thought he was fighting for and killed him self because of, is done!

This hypothetical is a BS. And you know it!
People in situations of heightened stress are highly suggestible & are looking for comfort & guidance.
For you to suggest that a man planting a seed in someone’s head in a VERY REAL LIFE OR DEATH situation is NOTHING is 
irresponsible!

I lived in Adelaide in 1999 and 2000, what an amazing place to spend a couple of working years. I was Sales Manager for Chubb Security at the time: I had a saying in Adelaide: if you find 6 strangers, they'll all know someone the others know, it's that small a city.

It's a frontier town without a frontier attitude. What started to get to me eventually was how Seattle never mattered. It was left out of lists & left off maps. People would say "Oh, I've heard it's nice..." or "I've always wanted to go there...". As a connector, that killed me.

I started bitching about it in 2009. By 2013, people were ready to kick me out. Apparently, unlike NYC, it is not expected that the citizens be critical of their city. Who knew? Pretty place. Glad I spent my 30s there. Good with not going back.

A do-not-resuscitate order, also known as a DNR, is a medical order that tells health care professionals not to perform CPR if a patient stops breathing or their heart stops beating. #Coronavirus https:// edition.cnn.com/2020/03/26/hea lth/coronavirus-hospitals-do-not-resuscitate-bn/index.html   …

I have mental health issues and have been indoors for three weeks. My consultant told me to go for a short, local walk. I’m quite lucky as I live in a tiny village so, go at 5:30am, watch the sunrise and go home.
I feel your anguish but we’re not all being idiots

being isolated 25 miles away from my parents, brothers and sisters and friends, my own mental health has found me in a very dark place. 
If I can bring joy to others through my art and photography it will mean the world to me.
Please be kind before you take to cyber yelling at me

Shes very lucky  My parents work in the hospitals w/ covid patients and they're out of absolutely everything. My  father is high risk and I'm super worried. hospitals are begging for supplies and hand sewn masks. They've been wearing trash bag gowns and the same mask for weeks.

I waited a few days for her body to heal a bit before tackling removing that claw.
Had to muzzle her & tie her up but when I snipped the claw she did not yelp at all; must be healing well. 
First I’ve seen her walk on that leg in several days. Good Girl, Lacy!   #dog pic.twitter.com/M3nfcCKkuH

The beauty of digital it afforded opportunities to those priced out of photography. For that, I love it. The craft of film I prefer but there is no faulting the quality, if done right.

Broadband, laptops, software...all come at a cost. A cost a growing number of the UK cannot afford. I fear that the education gap between the rich/fortunate and poor/unfortunate will just grow and grow.

So here are our peanut butter brownies, in honor of our wedding brownies (pictured last)

Yeah, I hear that. I hope that they’ve got you gloved up and distanced all to hell tho!

It’s been a long time since I’ve been home sick for this long and KNOWING that it’s at least a few more days. Usually I’d be pushing to go back ASAP.

Yuuuup. And I tend to distrust that one guy. They get on a roll with something decent and then for the sake of winning and stoping someone into the dirt the trust is frequently lost.

So....

Am I reading way too much into this, or does this seem like an amotional abusive type saw the dude in the vid say “I’m under a lot of stress” and ask people to be nice in the comments, saw weakness, and went in for the kill?

Could just be my history, but....

The way I am reading is that he’s saying “yes there might be a possible cure, I am limiting the prescribed to only those with symptoms or that have been diagnosed so the same aholes that stock piled all the tp and water don’t do it with these important meds” am I wrong?

Decided to @DoorDash  food for my family. Order showed delivered, it never came.The dasher stole the food, confirmed w/ @Rollinsmoke_bbq  They are amazing and resending. I can only hope the woman needed food for her family   I won’t be ordering food until all this dies down.

The US only banned flights form certain countries in mid March. There was no other action and they downplayed the threat. I was at LAX on March 16 and zero protocols were in place compared to @yvrairport  the same day with sanitation stations set up and health questions. 1/2

They’re 15+ish & lived w/their ppl (my friend’s Grandparents) since kittens. Gramma’s in a care home; then suddenly, unexpectedly, Grampa passed away!
Leroy adjusted right away.
Molly, his sibling, she’s still traumatized. But they are safe & I love them very much!

In Kansas (maga country) we see folks flocking to the home improvement stores and such, see non essential stores open, and few take the distance seriously....except the cashiers.  

Its infuriating to see full parking lots while we try ninja style trips for basic essentials

That’s how it works. We keep plugging along earning just enough if we’re lucky to buy stuff like houses and cars and other things. We collect debt. We put money in the stock market. Then we get old and they take it all from us before we die. We get to leave our debt as a legacy.

Neoliberal bullshit that panders to centrist nonsense. Once a YTer in that sphere becomes even a little successful, they turn into rich people bootlickers. 

it's cool if you find success but forgetting who fucking helped you get there is not 9k

Made sure the people who are closest to me stayed under quarantine and implemented proper health measures with others. I'm not rich, a doctor or a nurse, so perhaps I'm limited in what I can do, but I can make sure the right safety procedures are in place for those around me.

This means the outbreak's peak numbers will be infections contracted in early to mid April.

Hopefully, most Americans won't catch the virus.

But if you do, you do NOT want to be in that peak group, one that will stress or even break health care systems in some areas.

Is this something we're supposed to disagree on? I got really lucky that I moved to Virginia in 2017 and that fall we elected a Democratic majority in the State House. They finally expanded Medicaid. Electing Democrats helps people. Period.

In 2018, we took back the House with moderate Democrats winning red suburban districts. Progressives who did make it to their general lost across the board. We absolutely *have* to maintain that suburban voter coalition in 2020 if we're going to beat Trump....

Young people don't vote. Bernie isn't turning them out. He also isn't turning out new voters of any age. His entire thesis has fallen apart in this primary. If he were ACTUALLY bringing huge enthusiasm, you'd have a very good point. But Biden has been the one to turn out the base

2020-04-01 11:32:49
They understand that even the best white politicians are going to be a little racist. That's baked in. But they back the candidate they think is going to win and keep things from getting worse, with the hope that they may make it just a little better.

Sharing tip for health care friends! Use laminating film & create your plastic face guard you can just clean right after. Will be giving my stock to frontliners. In Asia we are required to wear face masks even to go outside and get supplies. #coronavirus  #frontlinersph  #covid19 pic.twitter.com/1K20pgdZHj

Self isolation & Quarantine signs:
- using so much soap & disinfectant lately that when you pee it cleans the toilet.
- when homeschooling and your kid says "I hope I don't have the same teacher next!"  
- Deciding where to go on Easter break - bedroom vs. Living room

It's a bright beautiful Spring day out, reminds me how lucky I am to be alive. To be breathing air into my lungs & feeling the warmth upon my skin. Going out to play w/ the dogs in a bit. Just waking. Slept through the migraine sickness, feeling a ton better.

There's a church here, and I'm sure one in every state, holding non-social distancing church service (while live-streaming). Defeats the purpose, really. Sunday school was open for kids. Older folk too. 

Governor, isn't going to be happy. #TogetherKy

The governor here has provided an allowance to get out for exercise, walk, jog, run. Just so it's 6 feet apart and not in a crowd. Other states disapproves of being out of their residence/yard.

Entire families, women, men, children and elderly, people who have run away from real wars, find themselves trapped  in "no man's land", waiting and hoping for solidarity or human mercy; a lending hand, some shelter, a piece of bread, or just a little bit of understanding.

I'm exhausted. I am still working 50 hours/wk (& BLESSED to) from home. I have three kids under 6 in the house. One autistic. One ADD. One 2yo spitfire. I'm homeschooling. I'm keeping things rolling. I could call it and not write.

Only, I can't. Because I must. #amwriting

Exactly. And even if they are implementing some kind of sanitation procedure, the workers are still in contact with each other every day and likely not wearing masks while they prep the food.  People getting takeout might as well just go back to work themselves IMO. Trust no one.

Have you seen Flu (2013)? Is a Korean movie that shows human tendency to protect themselves or the ones they love over common welfare. No matter how much trust a society has in their gov, disobedience is human nature over fear. This is why no country will ever have real control

This larger cultural gaslighting from #minorfeelings  echoed into gaslighting from my own family and community.  The rage is indescribable and like @cathyparkhong  and Sophia Chang, I found my voice and resistance within black culture and the black freedom movement.

This was like reading how a history book will write about the coronavirus in future. It's a damning and cautious articulation of our government's failure too protect it's citizens.
It's an absolute must-read. https://www. theguardian.com/us-news/2020/m ar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other   …

First Khabib said he'd fight Tony if there wasn't a travel ban. Turns out he could travel by private plane, but then Khabib brings up concerns about health. 

It's either he's worried about health or he couldn't travel.

@ amjoyshow  

As always, AM Joy is a day late and a dollar short

The people from the cruise ship were already leaving the ship on Friday. Yet you did not seem to be aware of that as you reported it as them not being allowed ot leave the ship. 

Try to keep up

It is very annoying

My therapist was concerned because I talked about having discovered the comfort of wearing stretchy pants. I was like "I'm not depressed. I'm just not wearing pantyhose anymore & it's AMAZING!".

This is why we have reached the #EndOfJobs . If there is no employer investment in workers, no employer obligation, what are we left with? We have moved to maximum insecurity & minimum shared responsibility. This only works if we have national safety nets. #JobEquityCOVID

A5. We need to decouple health care from jobs once & for all. We need to invest in robust child care systems. And we need to demand a geographically-responsive living wage. $15/hr doesn't cut it in most urban areas.

Capital as in financial capital. So unemployment is a loss of capital.

TBH I didn't realize "PAT" was no longer a thing... although I couldn't tell you what I normally say - now that I'm explicitly thinking about it my mind is polluted... ;)

but, seems like a nice one-syllable alternative to "Port Authority"?

so, I have this habit of changing the words to songs that get stuck in my head without my consent, so at least I can get some amusement out of it.

in this case, the relevant substitution is "totally big smelly fart".

you're welcome.

Well, if you actually need to be out of the house for an “essential” reason, then you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. I’m talking about the people who are going out, just to be out, without any regard for other people’s safety.

Obviously putting someone in jail could put many people at risk. While it is unfortunate that so many people have no source of income at the moment, maybe one should consider that before they choose to be reckless and ignore safety precautions because “they’re not worried”

The fact that every few months. There is discourse within the MMA bubble concerning the degree of courage a PRO FIGHTER possesses. It's such a glaring indictment of an otherwise amazing fandom. #KHABIBvsFERGUSON  #UFC249  @UFC

I met him at the #UFC229  weigh ins. Nice kid. But objectively his shtick gets a bit much. Even if I get it. Nevertheless, to each their own. What amuses me however is how some MMA fans tolerate his methods but can't stand The Schmo.

Because you'd think that if they did, a failure of testing should have been anticipated.

I didn’t see what she did! Anyway I can’t imagine her doing anything useful with her money. We r here trying to feed the homeless but not everyone has the quality of empathy and generosity. Thankfully lots of good souls donating time and money rn. I wish I could help w ur 400!

The Trader Joes and a few others in LA have us line up outside, six feet from the person next to you and they only let so many people in at once.

Who’s ready for the #MusicHealsChallenge ??
1. Pick a song.
2. Play it, sing it, dance to it, whatever you want.
3. Tell everyone about the song and artists.

Let’s help one another heal through music, all while getting some music education.

Trump: “We should be calm.”

The Truth: Confirmed cases of #COVID19  are doubling in the United States every day. Yesterday alone, there were 1200+ confirmed cases.

We should be calm, but we should be informed, be selfless, and be able to trust what we’re being told.

Yes that’s all true, easy to see this in similar light to abortion debate, and tensions within LNP a conscience vote would bring to surface again. For sake of those who spoke at committee inquiry’s hearings, I hope political advantage isn’t the primary driver of govt’s thinking.

The morning of the mass, I got to the church & there were people everywhere. I was shocked.

This little boy walked up to me and told me “I lost my daddy, too.”

Turns out, the church gardener had died, and that morning was his funeral.

Everyone, esp. late night hosts, are REALLY trying to comfort people with a sense of “normality”.

Consider.

This is a time to be selfless, kind, and compassionate. This is as clear as day. Working together is the only thing that will work. Selfishness, greed, blaming, arguing, denial... All that only prolongs the misery and deepens the damage. It's time to heal, let's just do it.

But a lockdown without a massive testing exercise is futile.

There have been cars in the @SCHEELS  parking lot every day during this global health CRISIS that is KILLING people. I just called to ask why & express frustration. The first mgr hung up on me, the 2nd said it's considered "essential business." @IAGovernor  NO, this has to change.

Thank you so much everyone who responded with supportive thoughts & comments.

Stay safe all.

Day 22

Today I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm getting those feelings out on paper.

I know we will get through this together. I know we will overcome. 

Part of being healthy though is owning ur feelings.

The last two days have been a roller coaster between grief & gratitude. Yesterday was mostly anger, today: exhaustion.   I haven't felt like talking the last couple of days... or cooking.

Okay yesterday was NOT the day.... Is today the day?!   
Honestly though guys, the NHS are absolutely remarkable. Midwives, Drs, nurses..every single one has been so so lovely, kind and reassuring. So lucky to be in the best hands! X

Democrat governors are banning the cure to coronavirus!

Makes sense now that Dems encouraged public gatherings up until March while  Trump was shutting things down

It is sad and difficult for us to learn those 1800 Americans that die daily due to bad diets and heart attacks, we should also remember those that die due to other major health issues and their heartbreaks are also newsworthy.
