Warren is truly wrong though. Everyone knows Bernie wanted Warren to run against Hillary in 2016.

But yes, Bernie & his supporters have pissed off even Tulsicrats and the #YangGang . They're so dismissive of Tulsi/Yang's policies. https:// twitter.com/KingOfClapBack s/status/1237730438749327360   …

My mental health drastically spirals downward when I am physically ill. I also tend to ruminate like I have blinders on to anything else.

Took anxiety meds.

As I said the physical illness drives my #anxietyattack  & there's nothing I can do to snap myself out of #pneumonia . I'm having some side effects from the shots & antibiotics that put additional pressure on me.#IBS  flared (antibiotic) & kidneys are hurting because of the shots.

I'm more than likely dehydrated (kidneys) but I've had so many fucking shots. Two sets of steroid shots, two different antibiotic shots, a shot for my lungs, & a toradol inner muscle shot. They've made my body a pharmacy which is really hard on the kidneys which is why they burn.

The point is analytics are a fine tool to look at simply for what they are. No difference than shots for versus against, but the problem is when people just look at them without context. Not all chances are equal, not all shots are equal and not all minutes played are equal.

Don't get me wrong. I want trump gone as much as anyone.

But the 25th is a pipe dream now. VP and cabinet members will never have an independent thought in their entire lives. That isn't going to change because of #covid19 .

So I don't understand the fixation on 25A, at all.

See, this makes a lot of sense to most people. And most VPs would probably land on these conclusions sooner or later.

I could be wrong of course. I don't know Pence and mostly go by his record.

Interesting that EVERYTHING Trump does that is incompetent (which is everything) can, so conveniently, be chalked up to “Fake News”. 
It’s as if he’s NEVER done anything wrong ever. It’s as if EVERY journalist & publication is the problem. At last we know what’s wrong w/America!

All of those meds are for heartburn and acid reflux. Zantac was pulled from shelves not too long ago because it was linked to cancer (which freaked me out as I took it). It's the incorrect sign, but funny none the less x

The 1918/19 flu pandemic came in three waves:
Spring 1918
Fall 1918
Winter 1919

2nd wave was by far the deadliest in the US, in part due to complacency over the summer and resistance by govt at all levels to do what had to be done to mitigate the outbreak during war time.

And maybe landlords ought to consider freezing rent collections until this is over, what with people needing to stay inside and unable to go to work.

But they probably won't, because greed.

You may be right, only time will tell. I can only comment on what I see - China is a country with no debt and holds much of America's debt in it's cash reserves. It has the support of most of the 1.4bn people who live here. The narrative that Chinese are unhappy is grossly wrong

 Imagine you have money.
It’s easy if you try.
And universal healthcare,
so you don’t have to die.

Imagine you have food,
while quarantined alone.
No fear of losing housing,
& your job, your car, your phone.

OTOH, Europe's Medicare4All systems were created in the terrible aftermath of the '18/'19 flu pandemic. 

It overlapped end of WWI, with a gazillion soldiers returning sick or grievously injured from a war of unprecedented brutality.

After that, Europe prioritized public health.

Same. 

It's like the mental stress of not having control over their daily lives the way they used to have is far more anxiety-inducing than the virus itself.

For that reason, I have little desire to be around people right now, even if I could be. Not much I can do for them.

In that analogy, they  can clearly see they are entering a dangerous building. The danger isn't as apparent with COVID19, plus it might not be themselves who will be harmed in any meaningful way, it could be others. Not saying they would get bored though just the analogy is poor.

I understand that people need to be careful and they should self isolate but the tsunami of articles from literally all media outlets about how how we are all going to die, and it will be terrible, isn’t helpful at this stage.

For the record. I was wrong.
Wrong to shout in ALL CAPS that I believed the shutdown completely UNnecessary

As of couple days ago, I am now self-quarantined. I have enough supplies for myself and my pets for a few weeks, staying in my dwelling. #covid19  #coronavirus  #quarantine pic.twitter.com/4Qi009uele

I fully agree. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I only needed to isolate due to the fear over the spread. And the fact that would not enjoy giving people a normal cold in this times.

Was frustrated coz when we called our provider, they don’t want to test him; said must be a flu. I think it’s because there aren’t enough testing kits & he’s young-ish. I have to fight him just to take his temp   but my worry is that he’ll harm others if he’s a carrier #COVID19

Kara, If we can set up burning man in a few days & various agencies can do refugee camps - we can set up isolation centers. 

The US military has exercises called strong angel to house tens of thousands of people in case of pandemic or, then, fear of a dirty bomb. It can be done

I have PTSD and an anxiety disorder. I haven't felt this calm, centered and in control of my emotions since before trump.

For the 1st time in 4 years, the next 12-18 mths have become predictable. Our path is locked in.

It is perilous, yet there is comfort in its certainty.

The problem isn’t the deaths, it is the clogging of the hospitals. In NYC for example they have 26k hospital beds and 8 million people. If just 5% require hospitalization that is 200k+ beds (u need to subtract your regular cases like heart attacks, cancer, births from the 26k)

Life lesson I’ve learned: The word “Family” doesn’t mean you owe your soul to people who treat you poorly. And it’s not wrong to admit that they are wrong for what they say. You cannot make them happy, or live up to their expectations. It’s okay to have boundaries.

I think it's not wrong calling spade a spade. Previously diseases were called by their source of origin. Be it Japanese encephalitis or MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). So we should focus on containment of virus instead of petty topic like calling it "Chinese virus."

KSR_I_AM

tbh, I am of this opinion from beginning. My thought of calling it "Chinese Virus" does not depend on whether Trump says it or not.  His way of saying might be wrong because of his position, though. Should have been more diplomatic.

Yeah, it comes from same SARS Virus family.

The problem is Bernie's too pragmatic. I think the dude legit thinks Trump is a bigger enemy than Biden. He's willing to bite his tongue for the greater good. I do not agree with that at all #NeverBiden . But, lesser of two evil and all that BS. pic.twitter.com/OnwGdYiy3X

Cause non locals are panicking. Many stay alone. Many have family back home. It's definitely gonna be a fearful experience as an outsider anywhere in the country to be stranded under a lockdown. I don't support this gathering. But yea this fear is among majority of non-locals https:// twitter.com/srivatsayb/sta tus/1241223054425853952   …

Dog can go where they want!
Cow can eat as much green grasses as they want!
Birds can sing whatever they want!
Squirrels are dancing!!
Real animals are blessing to mother Earth while social animals are just an evil!!

I’m so glad it has helped you. I’m here if you need 2 chat. I have anxiety, COPD & CPTSD & don’t fair well w/ isolation, so I can relate. I spoke with my GP & felt a lot better afterward. She was really open & honest w/ me about the virus & my risks. Have you spoken to your GP?

Yes. It’s so easy 2 use social media in times like this, & there’s nothing wrong with that if we set limits & make sure we are engaging with other activities, ppl etc. Don’t forget to go in your yard and feel the sun on your skin and listen to birds etc. & pls call your GP soon..

I see nothing wrong with this. Many Christmas lights, decorations and cards r made by Chinese prison labour.  In Australia, most of the car registration plates r made by prisoners. Australia was built on prisons and many of the US rural roads were too. Do the crime, do the time!

And, this is the same counter to Josh’s argument. Don’t use the police. There’s no other pov. Do it my way. I concede I could be wrong re: using police, but until I’m convinced - and I’m open to it - this is my view. Josh has, sadly, muted me anyway, so it all seem redundant now

“And when the evil of antisemitism took hold in our midst, our morality failed us.”

What the LP fails to acknowledge that it came from the ‘midst’, not took hold. Until they root out these vile racists nothing will change. This is Corbyn’s legacy. He enabled and encouraged it.

all Boris needs to do is announce a 2 week lockdown, except for those who ACTUALLY need to go to work. not many people seem to understand the term "social distancing" & they're putting themselves & others at danger #CoronavirusOutbreak

Boris Johnson really put the UK in further danger by not enforcing a lockdown. the excuse of "we believed they would listen to us & our advice" was stupid and moronic.

we need a lockdown NOW, otherwise the numbers in Italy will be repeated in the UK #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak

If schools aren’t providing for special education and students without access and thereby increasing equity gaps are they doing the right thing? Are you serious

Yes, I think it’s wrong to not educate certain students who are systematically excluded on a regular basis

Doctors need to take a hard look at the degree to which ventilators improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients & assess the best use of limited resources.

There are people w/ cancer who need surgical procedures now but can’t receive it due to the ban. Their lives are at stake.

We keep getting told we are on lockdown but everyone keeps going out for no reason. I’m convinced that if everything shut down for at least a week we would see a big difference in cases. Also I just want to believe that cause I have anxiety & this thought makes me feel better.

I was hospitalized in 2017 for a collapsed lung.  In ICU for almost 5 days.  Having family was what kept my spirits up and kept me going.  Being separated would absolutely kill me.  I’m staying home also.

Dear @realDonaldTrump ,
I hope one day you realize how truly stupid you are. Your lack of compassion for humanity and your greed (and the greed of your cronies) is going to be responsible for so much of this.

This has been my experience EXACTLY!  I actually thought one day, “Wow, I’m not having anxiety at all, and I feel pretty good about our prospects to just wait this thing out,” and then over the weekend it just smacked me on the head. Couldn’t stop crying, worried constantly.

# Coronavirustruth  Blocking countries, nationals or direct transportation makes no difference, people will dive it. Global spread of #coronavirus  is due individuals‘ fear or thinking their are over disease. You can’t block a disease, you develop local control measures and policies

That’s odd. Nurse from RPA called me yesterday mid-morning on a blocked number with the results. I wouldn’t bother with the hotline - call the hospital and ask if your results are ready. Maybe they copied the wrong contact number from your intake form? Fingers crossed you’re OK.

keep going and not crumble. I am staying informed, taking precautions, and taking all the information into consideration. Just like I did when I first started in news. 

While the pandemic is not familiar, fear and mass panic are old friends. Let’s stay safe & sane together. 3/3

I agree, I don't think they are bad people. I think it is just unfortunate that some club owners have stirred the bad press up because they've asked for help and they've shown their greed which then filters down the chain, but it's a reflection on the owners

His lack of education is astounding in general given the schools he “graduated” from, but for a US president it’s almost comical. It’s it wasn’t so incredibly sad, I’d be laughing. I genuinely fear for our safety right now with talks of trying to have churches open Easter.

Hey, friend: I've seen you mention depression, so heads up if you're on antidepressants or anxiety meds, OTCs like Benadryl, NyQuil or DayQuil negatively interact with one of mine, making me feel extra anxious/weird. May not be all, but perhaps ask pharm first.   Love & light!

Also, do not put your hairdryer in your mouth and breathe in the hot air for any reason. This won't kill the virus. Please don't.

There is ALWAYS something to write in a gratitude journal...(if you don’t have one, get one! Notebooks are perfect!) When we are forced into uncertainty it is natural to think of what all could go wrong or how…  https://www. instagram.com/p/B-PfQF6ASlA/ ?igshid=1x67dhnxck82f   …

I haven’t spoken with anyone who is feeling any different. The anxiety, fear and sense of vulnerability is real. All those I know are working hard to find a balance to negotiate these trying times. Trying to keep a healthy mindset during these times is so important.

Should we be concerned about packages, deliveries, groceries & grocery bags, cardboard boxes, the daily mail even? The short answer is YES   Read:  https://www. travelinglowcarb.com/27058/coronavi rus-and-packages/   …    This is not about fear, it’s about awareness - and awareness will SAVE LIVES.  pic.twitter.com/XI6zTtmRlj

Is it right that the football Association has now refused for the players to have a 30% pay cut to help pay the wages of staff?

I hope the footballers realise how lucky they are in wealth and choose themselves to actually help

I still think its greed, all that wealth

Hence the qualifier "confirmed".

Confirmed cases give us a window on what's happening in any one area. And, importantly, an idea of whether or not the number of sickest people is going up or down.

Some data > no data.

And "some data" =/= totally wrong, useless data.

At 2-1 up coach Dick Advocaat took out Robben, who was in top shape and about to force a 3-1 lead. But after he left the pitch his danger was neutralized and Czech could grab a 2-3 victory.

So....

Am I reading way too much into this, or does this seem like an amotional abusive type saw the dude in the vid say “I’m under a lot of stress” and ask people to be nice in the comments, saw weakness, and went in for the kill?

Could just be my history, but....

Did you hear what @POTUS  Trump said on @foxandfriends  this morning?!

He said when he took office there was almost NO ammunition in our stockpiles AND almost NO medical equipment. 

At that time, Democrats were desperately trying to start a war with Russia.  

Let that sink in...

The thing for someone like me is that I'm a perfectionist. It's a terrible thing to be, truly, because I always think I've fallen short and always think I've failed. 

I'm trying to take this time to inject a little confidence into my heart to take more chances without fear.

I’ve learned to never to be absolutely, positively sure about something I know little about because if it turns out that I had it wrong, I won’t look like a total, fucking idiot.
Trump needs to figure that out.

“I guess I had it wrong and I’m sorry about that. Also, I should maybe listen more to the people who are specialists in this field and stop making things up if I don’t understand. I’m truly sorry, I’ll try harder and try to think a little more before I speak”

It peeved me off to see yet another #church  having service. How can you justify, as a preacher, large exposure to a potentially fatal virus to pass the plate around? I couldn't live w/ myself if people got sick and it would kill me if the old died because of selfishness.

Similar, report. The first week quite severe symptoms.  Going into this third week life is so much more a simple life. I feel I have control. I feel steady. At times, I do get high anxiety but I've reached that level of acceptance where it seems my #bpd  has calmed.

So not advancing the white power structure somehow includes white men telling women of color that they are wrong and demanding they defend their position by concluding if it isn’t validated it’s not true... WEIRD... that feels like supremacy to me...
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 10:51:48
You’re allowed to think that... I’m allowed to disagree 

Now are we addressing white males telling women of color that they are wrong about white supremacy or is your only priority telling me Sonia is wrong ?
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 10:55:42
If you aren’t going to address white men speaking with authority on white supremacy and dismissing women of color and assuming authority then I don’t know if I truly care about your opinion as you can’t stand up for us

Had I heard she’s wrong but y’all need to back up... maybe
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 11:18:40
I guess I am just wrong for letting those centrally impacted take authority after sharing my thoughts on the relevant thread 

You can go through my replies and see what I actually said on that but why bother as it won’t suit your narrative
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 11:22:09
So did you read... I think I said if a POC says Sonia is wrong cool... agree to disagree.  First tweet bud... reading is fundamental 

If a POC says Sonia is wrong but doesn’t address the racist and anti-black behavior you exhibit then their opinion isn’t going to carry weight
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 11:55:26
Because if you cared about dismantling white power structure you would call out white men taking authority on conversations about race and demanding labor through debate WHILE telling us why you thought Sonia was wrong
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 11:56:10
But I forgot some men of color only dismantle white power structures but have no intention of protecting women of color.... 

Bud... thanks for letting me know you thought Sonia was wrong.  Got it loud and clear 

Maybe next time address the problematic white man too...
17
jennthetutor
2020-03-31 11:57:41
Or doesn’t dismantling white power structures only involve you calling out problematic behavior of women of color 

all the women of color here... told we are wrong 

All the white men... not addressed until asked to be addressed 

But we have the issue of authority... k bud...

Hope I’m wrong about this but here’s my prediction: If Trump pulls USA through this now, China will release another virus in the fall before #Election2020  
They’ve already warned us ‘COVID19 may come back’. 
It will be different. They will say it mutated. It will be worse.

Half my anxiety is caused by the rapid proliferation of COVID in NY.
The other half, by my parents who keep sending me Yoga videos.They believe it’s the only COVID cure we have.

This is a time to be selfless, kind, and compassionate. This is as clear as day. Working together is the only thing that will work. Selfishness, greed, blaming, arguing, denial... All that only prolongs the misery and deepens the damage. It's time to heal, let's just do it.

escape her simulation. But to do this in the rehoboam sim is going to take a much bigger distraction. I think the real world outside of the simulation has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Saroc keeps running these simulations to see if it could have been prevented. Let's see.....

He’s not going to be able to save his red states from #COVDI19  They still don’t take this seriously. Trump lied to them and they believe him. The virus will spread like wild fire. They don’t have hospitals or medical staff to deal with what’s coming. He’s going to kill them. https:// twitter.com/rogertansey/st atus/1246469397494910976   …

As a business owner, it is hard to talk about my mental health struggles. Many times I’ve been made to feel like it’s “too much”. But this is who I am. I have anxiety and depression and honestly, I don’t always do so well with that.

I'm sorry, so stressful. My brother runs a medical clinic (not Dr but admin side) but he's dealing w/infected patients and my mom is a respiratory therapist. So I totally understand worrying about them. And it makes it hard b/c we can't see them either for fear, right? Kills me

I want to go on a food run just to get out, but then I think about what it would mean if I'm the one that gets this thing. Even if it doesn't kill me, I have to quarentine for 14 days & my fam wouldn't b ok w/that. But the isolation is depressing me. Stay healthy my friend

My friend told me he'd save me if I stay in the warehouse (Isle) and he got shot by another friend who was now gonna save me.

He fucking got shot and managed to kill the person who shot him.
I'm alone in the warehouse and I woke up to Stan luckily he got his attention elsewhere
