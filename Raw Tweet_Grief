I know someone who could speak to the anxiety and depression piece. She's based in Preston + is a trauma-informed coach (uses RRT - a mix of hypnotherapy with NLP). Would she be a fit?

I could barely make it through the first video. This man's screams are haunting. The terror he was in, believing he was about to die at the hands of the police made me physically sick. All for allegedly smoking a joint. This shit has to stop. https:// twitter.com/TheVelvetRope_ _/status/1235391987332702208   …

This isn't a matter of seriousness. It's about the impact public words have.

Hating on trump is fine if that gets you thru the day.

But know there are ways of publicly hating him that do not inflict emotional collateral damage on millions of people. Ignoring that is a choice.

John Cena's dominance got to a point where no one won no matter strong they got pushed. It got tiresome cuz it seemed redundant. Or worse, when he did lose it would happen on a less significant stage and then he'd win the blow off match at the Royal Rumble or something.

It honestly depends on a case to case basis. If you have a temp over 101 degrees Fahrenheit, severe chest pain, it’s hard to breathe even just sitting down, and your whole entire body is in extreme pain then go for the test but even then who knows if they will even give you one

Haven't the words to describe the excruciating #pain  of a pulled chest wall muscle. It's lessened some since I found a way to have mobility & still have a tight compression on the spot which to the touch is so tender. Hopefully, over the next few days it will subside.

But it might just inoculate you from losing hope. Or from emotional detachment. Or from fear & anxiety. (If only for 46 minutes.)

The plastic containers you list are recyclable. Plastic bags are NOT! Paper bags are recycleable!!! But you don’t need to pay for them if you JUST BRING YOUR OWN REUSABLE BAGS! Only selfish monsters happy to pollute the ocean are upset about the ban. I SUPPORT THE #PlasticBagBan

Amanda Bynes didnt handle it badly. She developed bipolar disorder and as far as I'm aware, schizophrenia. She also accused her father of physical and sexual abuse so her behaviour stems from her mental health and her abuse history

The AMOUNT of people straight up saying Amanda Bynes shouldn't be allowed her child when she gives birth just because she has bipolar disorder is disgusting. Mental health DOES NOT mean you'll be a bad parent AND she will have people helping her should she require it.

An emotional gambit with low odds of success. By leaving Trump in power longer you risk further erosion of the system that you hope can elect a progressive candidate in the future. Again, you have to change minds for the movement to succeed.

Excellences of all the other countries even thanked PM Modi & India for such conference as well as help. But that Pakistani creep was ridiculous, not even named India or PM Modi for once. I don't think this terrorist nation deserves any support from India!

I live a life that is very flexible and constantly changing. The days are so different. I think that's why I find it comforting to start my day with ritual. Grounding activity at the beginning and then go with the flow of the day's needs/creativity, etc.

That problem is you are using SA 10% to forecast his impact and support he has in the continent. Please don't use wrong stats prediction. but u can forecast 10% of African population who might be in support of him. But its still a scary number which can make him an African leader

After the market and total economic tank at the end of 2008 the Bush gang said they never saw it coming.  Inept!

Most people who come to the pharmacy are a bit tensed and I totally understand that.
But today there was a lady, who paused before leaving, looked me in the eyes and told me to take care and be strong.
And I think I am a little emotional now

The test can be taken any other day, you can pay for an SAT day for the kids who miss the test.  

It is completely reckless to allow students to gather together for the sole purpose of taking a test, reckless.

Providing care for an aging parent is extremely difficult. Especially when the forgetfulness makes them frustrated and that frustration comes out in anger. It comes and goes with mom, like a turn of a cheek one minute mad the other normal. But she's in that stage atm.

Anxiety increases with quiet surrounding yet loudness within. Thoughts spiraling w/ fear of the "unknown". Unsettled, angered that I cannot run & I'm forced again into a box reminded of my captive traumas in childhood. That is unpleasuable suffering I grapple with daily now.

Self-isolating as much as possible. My mother insists that her church activities are essential and is not 100% self-isolating yet. Her husband is nearly 90 and recently had heart surgery. Very frustrated. Anyone else trying to convince an elderly parent to stay home?

# smalltowninertia  Emptied my bank account to get the folks (& us) enough tins of food (1 a day p/person) for a month. That’s all the self isolation we could afford. It’s a pain & a stress but due to folks high risk status RE this bug, doing my best to keep them safe!.

Quick clarification:

It took 3 months and 2 accounts (already) to get the device, and now that there's a software issue they can’t resolve, the suggested solution is for me to create a new account…just so they can send me a new SIM?

A friend of mine said there are DSHS (WA State welfare office) workers who have tested positive for the virus but have to continue to work or the entire system would basically collapse for those in need. So this is also the time to reconsider universal basic income.

You may be right, only time will tell. I can only comment on what I see - China is a country with no debt and holds much of America's debt in it's cash reserves. It has the support of most of the 1.4bn people who live here. The narrative that Chinese are unhappy is grossly wrong

That's worse than the Great Depression, which was about 25% unemployment and 30% drop in GDP.  But Great Depression was causing by economic failure and this is medical/health related so not sure how equal the comparison can be.

Might socialize among themselves but still in contact with population afterwards. Should lockdown for this initial surge of virus but worry is later resurgence. This isn't going to be done and probably endemic. But for the moment best to isolate and deal with other factors later

He shouldn’t have said that he doesn’t care if he dies from Covid19 coz he’s out & about. If the leader dies, there’ll be more disorder. He might also encourage the impressionable few to have the “que sera sera attitude” to just go out when we need them to stay home

OTOH, Europe's Medicare4All systems were created in the terrible aftermath of the '18/'19 flu pandemic. 

It overlapped end of WWI, with a gazillion soldiers returning sick or grievously injured from a war of unprecedented brutality.

After that, Europe prioritized public health.

I could be jaded by life experience, but I think human beings want something they can’t have, life greener on the other side etc... take it away, place restrictions, and they suddenly want it. Make it freely available (whatever ‘it’ is) and it’s taken for granted.
2

We were creek and drain kids too.  The leech and tick check was pre bath ritual for us all.  

They should have been checking for oil.  We found out later, the Amoco facility was leaking where we *played* & dozens of Sugar Creek fams developed cancers & MS.

Do not mistake my positivity for passivity. We are self-isolating. I am working as long as I can, but I know that could dry up any moment. We have stocked up on essentials and are monitoring the situation. 

Stay home, folks. Flatten the curve. Be smart, but don't lose your head.

I have PTSD and an anxiety disorder. I haven't felt this calm, centered and in control of my emotions since before trump.

For the 1st time in 4 years, the next 12-18 mths have become predictable. Our path is locked in.

It is perilous, yet there is comfort in its certainty.

He got done what he was politically able to get done at the time. He wasn't perfect. I'm critical of him on many fronts. But the only reason Rs are able to do a cash bailout is because they know the Dems will support them. If the roles were reversed. Rs would fight it. Come on.

Folks, he might just have a ceiling of support.
3
AndrewRedlawsk
2020-03-19 22:47:23

You don’t have to thrust your political talking points everywhere.

This weekend I came to encounter three different opinions, this weekend, with regard to #COVID19 . The first, universal, it is a very contagious infection like the flu. The second, the idea I subscribe to, fear is a distraction. The third a war on people by government authorities.

Please implement emergency financial measures to ensure small businesses survive the crisis. Please give the people the income they are losing so they don't also lose their homes. It's crucial that we not only protect our health, but also our finances.

I have the same concerns. I don't think we are over reacting health wise, but as we are responding we are creating an economic crisis and doing almost nothing to curb that. We are running the world into financial recession, if not depression. It's truly terrifying on all fronts.

My husband's job; we literally have less than $300 in savings so we can't lose income.

I think it should stack with WIC but not with SNAP to be honest. Only because WIC is for babies (and women, I know I know). But unless you’ve had a child, you do not understand the financial strain that formula, diapers, wipes, and other products can have on a family.

Covid19 for 99%+ of those afflicted ranges from ‘I barely felt sick’ to ‘Ugh, I felt awful.’ The 1% in acute distress are barely able to speak (from my first-hand witness). For many, there is a neurological and respiratory distress component. They aren’t tweeting.

I keep repeating that church events seem to be one of the worst for infections. It's happened in #Singapore  #France  #SouthKorea  and now very possibly in #USA  People have responsibilities to no longer partake in these old traditions.  #coronavirus  #FlattenTheCurve  #SlowtheSpread

Exactly but I guess not in Ireland.  Must be some special strain wandering around there. And people  returning from matches in UK?  Or Cheltenham?   No concerns there?  So many potentials for infection.  #FlattenTheCurve  #COVID19ireland  #coronavirus

8/ Finally, since self-isolation is really a service to public health and those that are much more vulnerable to the virus, I also felt that I didn't want to take testing capacity away from those that need it more urgently than I do.

alexmensch
2020-03-14 08:52:08
To be 100% clear, if widely-available, accurate testing was available (eg. South Korea) I would not hesitate to get tested. It’s the lack of clarity around who has the disease by the unavailability of testing and the risk to more vulnerable individuals that forces this situation.

On a serious note the #schoolclosuresuk  will highlight just how many vulnerable children simply cannot be at home at the moment. I think the Tory government will be shocked. BoJo mentioned private schools twice during last night’s speech.. he’s clueless to those in need!

2020-03-18 02:43:18
Also, usually can't test without having come in contact with a confirmed case. But if we don't test, how do we confirm cases? Isn't more pertinent to catch early cases b4 they become dire & need to go to the ER? Also, we have a 4 mos old baby and a 4 yo with respiratory issues.

I understand that the issue is we don't have enough tests to just test/man power everyone. And these are the repercussions of poor leadership. People are going without diagnoses, risking lives, simple bc someone decided it wasn't a big deal. Or it made them look bad.

Day 4

All restaurants are closed now. Sidewalks and streets are... safe to bike on.

I thought I'd enjoy all this space more. 

The eerie absence of audible urban wallpaper won't let me. 

It's like reverse noise. 
Disturbing by its absence.

I tweeted that a couple weeks ago, to expect life to be drastically different for the next 12-18 months, at least. Because pandemics do their own thing, tend to come in waves on their own schedule and they don't end quickly.

Reactions at the time? Apathy and disbelief.

Wednesday and Pugsley were the first set born, on top of me while I was sleeping. I woke up to Luna and two of the prettiest kittens on my legs. Wednesday is a torte  act&s like a monkey, and Pugsley Bagheera is my mini black panther/ gargoyle. They are not happy unless in my lap

Second litter of Kittens from Luna, Mortica, Gomez, and Fester. Mortica is tiny for full grown and is solid black, Gomez is another mini panther, and Fester is silver grey and lanky. They are the biggest lovers.

Luna's last and final litter were all girls. Daenerys, Sansa, and Arya. They are all 3 solid black. Daeny has a a straight tail, Sansa has a zig zag at the end of her tail, & Arya has a crook at the end of her tail. They are other wise identical to their sister Mortica.

All of those kittens were fathered by Leviathan. A massive black cat who is also  Luna's father. Yes we had inbreeding. We tried to stop it. Luna was a ninja. All the cats are fine, and fixed now. Levi is such a independent outside cat. He is a beast with a genetic zig zag tail.

Tails = You're empty, a hollow husk, emotionless or emotional, depressed

The coin is flipped daily, how will it land? How will you react to this gamble?

Overlap of WWI & 1918/19 pandemic was deadly as that flu strain killed mostly young adults, incl soldiers.

So info on flu severity/mortality was kept secret in WWI nations, which worsened death toll.

I’ve been violently coughing for days, have trouble breathing, my heart rate SKYROCKETS when I just stand up, my chest/eyes ache, but can I get tested? No.

So this AM, gotta own it - I messed up big late last night. Wasn't total disaster - maybe 1000 calories. Up 1/2lb today. 

Not stopping at 5 days now though. 

Let's go another 5! :)

I need a second opinion! I'm currently in "self isolation" which ends later this week. When it ends, I'm then into "social distancing". 

Does this mean I can finally go outside for a solo run? Or hit the hills for a bit of hiking?

Quarantine Day 10

Keeping calm during lockdown because it's unbearable to keep mine things well as well families too.

I hate to say this but family should support rather than degrading his child by mental taunt.

Social distancing takes longer than two weeks to ward off an epidemic. The 1% knows that, but would rather us die than lose a few more months of business.

No.  You aren’t missing anything.  Apparently us telling you that women of color and Black women exist is “hateful”

So far in self isolation: Watched the Toy Story franchise, accidentally consumed too much vodka and called my bf crying about the emotional intricacies of Toy Story, received suggested ads for sweat pants, and developed a small cough which has me slightly paranoid.

The most galling part of GA Senator Kelly Loeffler's profiteering is that we didn't even elect her. She was appointed to replace Isakson, who resigned due to "health concerns." She was sworn in January 6th. She traded away that stock less than THREE WEEKS after taking office.

Lots of ppl asking.   Haven't received COVID test results yet, despite being tested Wed. Trying to wait b4 I go get tested for pneumonia or get antibiotic to prevent it from getting worse. If +, I have to go to ER, which cost me $100 co-pay last Fri. So, prefer urgent care.

Being reminded of how #WrestleMania30  was just such a weird card. The emotional high in seeing Daniel Bryan's story payoff along with the shock of seeing The Undertaker's streak end. Which was diminished a little due to how the match with Lesnar itself turned out. #WWEonESPN

Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker could've been great but Taker FOR REAL got concussed during the match and finished on autopilot. Ironically it worked out storyline wise. Lesnar "conquering" The Streak in such a lackluster way added to his heat. #WrestleMania30  #WWEonESPN

Hey Celebrities. Where’s all of your outrage & compassion for humanity  now? Put your money where your pretentious whining (cough) I mean mouth is & actually help those in need. Now’s your time to shine from those ivory towers you lecture us from.

I spent a week talking with ER doctors. These guys need more space, more #PPE , more equipment and REST. 

Once #COVID19  hits other cities our system will collapse. #morethanmasks https:// twitter.com/kit_delgadomd/ status/1242177100443987977   …

Have you ever seen a Zombie movie? Do you understand that it's usually premised on a killer virus? So you don't end up undead with this one. Just regular dead. The spread rate is rapid. There's no containment. Would you go back to work with Zombies running wild?

S.Korea responded faster and better than crisis denier Trump which preserved their economy. It's too late for that in US.
Also there are no statistics on the numbers of people who died from starvation during the depression. It wasn't tracked.

A couple things on the Internet world buzzing around.1)when Trump said “we will win”,he’s not talking about the virus; he’s talking about the election.2)he let this happen to us, while he was informed 1/3/20, 3)this is the ultimate distraction while his friends are getting richer

Before ACA, I was on parent’s insurance. I went to buy the same plan after aging out  I was told I could because of a pre existing condition

That condition- anxiety & depression after 5 people I knew were killed at Virginia Tech/ my mentor died

I could not get covered until ACA https:// twitter.com/BarackObama/st atus/1242099236231053314   …

I was denied coverage because of the Virginia Tech Massacre and the anxiety/depression I faced after losing 5 people I knew.  I did not get coverage until you passed this act.  I didn’t go to the doctor out of fear. Now (well before the virus) I have preventative care. Thank you

Do you know how many schools a have a higher sat than the average Black student’s sat in the state of Virginia... off the top of your head. Because I do... 

I also know these students are routinely under served and the gaps will only get wider

You can’t prep your way out of systematic inequity in all cases

2020-03-24 11:05:52
If the average sat & act score starting score for white students starts higher than black students and they both invest in prep then the black student after a 300 point increase would still be behind his white peer

with digital equity and sped equity issues this year, gap widens
10
jennthetutor
2020-03-24 11:06:29
And if you have anxiety or testing issues or need accommodations those gaps just increase 

A study guide doesn’t resolve that

And we are only 195 ppl less as confirmed cases + considering population wise BC has approx. 1M more ppl then us and even being  "ground zero" you'd think it would be worse there, no?

Well most women will prep themselves to look good in the ID (I’m guilty of that as well) so the black and white one looks like  she is ready...and the color one looks imo when makeup is taken off. This is just Imo cause I be like that too.

Tonight I wanted to get my mind off of everything, to soothe this #anxiety  that doesn't even subside with medication for it. Mom and I are watching "Madea Goes to Jail" I can't believe I haven't seen this one before.

Late night, solo, "me time" arrived about a an hour ago.  Sitting here in a hoodie trying to get warm in my peace. Watching "Ozark" from the beginning. I heard season 3 is great and I can't wait until I get there from this refresher.

I've been hesitant in dating men 10 yrs younger than me for a variety of reasons; however, my exp w/ those around my age & older over last 2 yrs has not been great. I know it's relative, but maybe younger are less jaded from previous relationships & more emotionally available.

7. Make a plan. Call your doctor, and any other specialists you may have, to find out what their protocols are. Call local health facilities to find out their plans, as well. It’s better to be prepared than to be frantic in an urgent moment. Stay calm! Write it all down.

The UFC's parent company is laying people off across all of their properties. This explains in part why Dana is so intent on pushing forward to book events. I'm speculating but this seems like a continue working or some folks will lose their jobs scenario. #Coronavirus https:// twitter.com/Variety/status /1242886051560968193   …

With the government announcing #ReliefPackage  for the next 3 MONTHS,mind you NEXT 3 MONTHS, it is highly unlikely that the situation would be contained by 15 April, so the probability of landing in scenario 2,3

I began experiencing a bit of chest pain on the sixth day and sore throat too. The pain would come and go. But when it would occur, you won't be able to breathe, it was so bad. The ninth day when I felt it getting worse. I saw the doctor. He told me to take some meds.

Paracetamol tablets, pain killers, cough syrup, and a bunch of other meds too. I could not sleep for continuous 5-6 days and it was getting harder. At one point, I literally felt, that this was it. Maybe, this is how it happens. But, a call with my brother just made it better.

However, we have to take other things into account and look at the bigger picture when discussing testing too, because in Japan, if you have flu symptoms you go to the ENT, do the unpleasant swab test and find out if you have flu strain A or B. This is unheard of in Australia. 3/

Data? Not during the war. Retrospective we will. I can say that all who have entered ARD final fatal stage either had heart, kidney or respiratory disease. Lots of respiratory. The meds seem to blunt the progress to ARD. E

HCQ alone isn’t what is effective. Needs to be the trifecta meds and it’s still anecdotal. We are in real-time trial. Appears to blunt symptoms and halt the potentially fatal final stage of ARD. Still sheds 30+ days regardless.

There are SO MANY reasons why sending people back to work and prioritizing the economy doesn’t make sense.
You’re putting doctors and nurses at risk. You’re putting other essential service workers at risk. We could lose so much more than we already will.

I feel he was because he was clearly preying on vulnerable women.  The main reason I don’t think she did it was the lawyer who hates her seems to think she did not do it, and he had other enemies.  He seemed like a rich asshole who was involved in a bunch of shady things.

Great thread on the crisis in local newspapers, which has been massively accelerated, but not caused, by Covid-19. 80% of all UK local newspapers are owned by only 5 companies. This model makes the papers vulnerable as their corporate owners chose profit over their newsrooms. https:// twitter.com/GraemePatfield /status/1245649914870153218   …

It's important we show compassion & respect for each other.

Saying "it could always be worse" is dismissive of one's personal experience & emotions. It's all relative. Of course, in ALL life situations, things could be worse, but this is NOT an empathetic or comforting response.

Through this you’re learning how many people really have nothing to lose and don’t care about life and death. That’s why they couldn’t social distance and do the right thing   and that is on a global level.

Speaking from personal experience, & from what I’ve seen with my own eyes. I’m well within my rights to “bash” those within the religion who commit, cover up & enable the abuse that had gone on for decades. Personally, I wouldn’t leave my kids with a Priest. & that says enough.

Capital as in financial capital. So unemployment is a loss of capital. 

On the second point, true. But if we treated this as a wartime moment, we would ensure health coverage for all (social safety net).

Agree, it’s little surprise they’d have a decent showing in Bundamba, esp at a by-election. But their inconsistent support (not to mention shambolic party organisation) isn’t riding any groundswell movement like in 1998. Still, if they campaign smart they could gain seats in Oct.

If I put myself through the financial and emotional trauma of getting a PhD, I’d make everyone call me “Doctor” too. It’s not her fault that years ago someone decided we’d use the same word for medical and academic professionals.  People need to chill.

Wait, "He's *not* required any non-invasive respiratory support"

So, Boris HAS received invasive respiratory support? Ie, he's on a ventilator? I mean why else would he be in ITC rn? #BorisJohnson  #QuarantineLife  #coronavirusuk

Yeah. But CPAP is *not* invasive, & the whole point of it was to keep ppl *out* of ICU. Raab has p much just implied that #BorisJohnson  *does* require invasive support, ie ventilation.

@ gumdrop92 : Let's not make assumptions, rather show some compassion. Being alone isn't a negative, but being alone w/o physical human connection for 18 days like I've been CAN get lonely & impact one mentally since it's out of our normal routine or needs. Our feelings are valid.

People’s individual suffering can be noted, helped, and prayed for all while standing up to those who continue to exacerbate a dire situation. If I knew my words were hurting innocent people, I’d change them. This situation isn’t a free pass for heinous behavior.

The thing about having something to prove is it's a void you'll never be able to fill. Even if you prove one thing it'll always lead to more and more things to prove. The only person you should be proving something to is yourself.

The redemption arc doesn't surprise me cause I knew that were about to do that the moment they killed Han Solo (didn't mean that I wanted it to happen) , but the thing I really didn't want was having another big villain above him to call the shots. That's what is upsetting to me.

The type of pain does not matter; the important thing is that the pain experienced is unpleasant. Because anger never occurs in isolation but rather is necessarily preceded by painful feelings, it is often characterized as a ''secondhand'' emotion.

Don’t let the haters stop you from pursuing what is right. You have lot of love around you, lot’s of support.. somehow, we tend to hear more hate than love. But remember, you can change lives by influence them positively

I’m not sure about that, I thought it’s the case if boiled not soaked in cold water. but I would rather give up some nutrients to having bacteria on my spinach. I also store them in the freezer so i definitely lose more nutrients but no clue what else to do.

CDC changed the recommendation to wear masks now, and NY in particular is making a bit thing about wearing cloth face coverings & leave the masks for medical professionals. Other states possibly too, but I’m having trouble looking outside the borders of my home state disaster.

My aunt who lived in Stockholm needed surgery for her breast cancer at 80. 

They refused it because of her age. 

They gave her pain meds and sent her home to die. 

This was devastating for our family.
