Practice good health habits: wash hands for at least 20 secs w/ soap, cover your mouth when you cough, and if you have symptoms of #COVID19  STAY HOME (do NOT go to school or work) and immediately contact your healthcare provider. If you don’t have/can’t afford a doctor, call 211.

Just like hurricane season, prepare for #COVID19 : 1) have a plan, 2) make a kit, 3) stay informed. 

Plan for what u need if u or someone u know gets sick. 

Make an emergency kit: hand sanitizer (60%+ alcohol), dry food & water, and extra medications in case shortages occur.

I have to get a root canal but can’t for 2 weeks & my face hurts. I wanted ice cream last night to soothe but the cold is extremely painful so I made some cookie dough. 

It’s pathetic, yes, but not tragic.

I'm a SAHM, I mentioned the grandparent situation because its a real risk. 

I'm offering free childcare to friends so that they can work without putting grandparents at risk. 

Missing 6 weeks of school is a huge loss too. I'm not a teacher so I'm worried they will miss out.

“Healthy” people can carry the virus for up to 14 days before showing symptoms.  That whole time they are spreading it. Just using wipes isn’t enough. It’s not alarmist to encourage people to stay home. At this point it’s necessary. Our hospitals can’t handle the patient volume.

@ UniofExeter : take note. I'm a disabled Occasional Teacher who's spent hours preparing lectures & seminars that may get cancelled. The thought of not being paid for ANY of this work if #UoE  goes into lockdown is what's making me put my health, & that of my carers, at risk. https:// twitter.com/dontscab/statu s/1238825371614806017   …

While you are at it how about addressing the absolutely broken characters you keep introducing? You have left the originals nearly unplayable, meanwhile characters like Hulda and Sakura are completely broken. Can stop execution animations? no problem. 14 hits to 3....no problem.

Telling people to stop panic buying is as useful as telling a manic depressive to stop feeling sad. As abhorrent as this behaviour appears to be, this is somewhat normal behaviour for humans who are in a constant state of the unknown.

Absolutely not every move is going to be perfect, but if you master timing you mitigate the risks that you take. 

Like the Muzzin addition, perfect timing that gave the team time to gel before last year's playoffs and had an additional year of control.

But it might just inoculate you from losing hope. Or from emotional detachment. Or from fear & anxiety. (If only for 46 minutes.)

weather modification (also known as weather control) is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow.

Whilst I agree with the issue that this is way overhyped, there is still a need to be wary because constant transmission of a virus will cause mutations and we have no idea what will happen then. Until a vaccine is found - take care, but dont panic

I'm a 50 yo woman with a high risk spouse about to go meet my mother (fresh from a funeral w/ 200 out of town cryers) in a public space because I still can't take the judgement of being the black sheep who declined the invitation to be graced by her rare presence. #pandemic

The unclear and paliguy-liguy statement of the President, is not just about him reading and translating the memo.

It's the lack of concrete explanations and protocols that were laid down, makes it useless bec we are left with so much questions that will lead to more panic.

It's not disrespect if it wasn't done well. If anything, letting the business know it wasnt done well from the start is showing more respect.
And there's a big difference between evolving the brand and rebranding. Evolution, fixing what was broken, is a very respectful work ethic

I think this has to happen. It's the only thing that worked to stop the spread in China. Other countries are doing it. If Trump doesn't do this and things get completely out of control, it will end his chances of reelection. It's happening, friend. Monday most likely.

So this author has been advised to #selfisolate  for 7 days. What’s weird is the symptoms from the UK government are different to those of @WHO  I tick the boxes on WHO’s list but only one on the UK list. 
But the girl on 111 advised me to self isolate anyway. I may be infectious—

Providing care for an aging parent is extremely difficult. Especially when the forgetfulness makes them frustrated and that frustration comes out in anger. It comes and goes with mom, like a turn of a cheek one minute mad the other normal. But she's in that stage atm.

You know you love your dog when he wakes you up at 4 am because he had too many treats, drank too much water & now needs to pee but can’t go to the backyard alone because he’s afraid of the wind, so you stand out there in sub zero temperatures in a t shirt waiting for him #love

Me and @DanhausenAD  share the same favorite horror film TCM2. My favorite part is when Dennis Hopper is buying chainsaws or when Leatherface and Chop Top show up to the radio station. Such a great film/franchise. I knew there was something I liked about him.

Ok so super fun, after having a slight temp post holiday at work today they have now gone full panic mode and I have been sent home for 7 days of isolation. I do have a temp but feel for the most part fine just a little tired. So now need to occupy myself. Help. #selfisolating

They're not testing enough people. If people in Montgomery County have it. People in Arlington have it. There's too much travel in the area for it not to spread. Also, when people do call their doctors with Covid19 symptoms, at least in my case, the doctors didn't do testing

Same. 

It's like the mental stress of not having control over their daily lives the way they used to have is far more anxiety-inducing than the virus itself.

For that reason, I have little desire to be around people right now, even if I could be. Not much I can do for them.

This is why we need to take self isolation & social distancing seriously, right now.

I have the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, fluctuating temperature.

Chris Whitty says community transmission is already happening. Not to mention the significant number of asymptomatic cases.

We obviously can’t test every single person with symptoms, so social distancing is the only option, surely.

Precisely this: “I’ve seen at least three people with severe disease who weren’t allowed to be tested, and heard of dozens more.” We aren’t testing community cases that clinically look like coronavirus, here’s why that’s a BIG problem: https://www. independent.co.uk/voices/coronav irus-uk-doctor-nhs-hospital-symptoms-italy-china-a9397736.html   …

I'm so sorry.   Social distancing is the responsible thing to do until we have more facts (and testing). Voluntary isolation too, if you're in a position to do so. I'm young & healthy so not afraid of the virus itself but staying home to not participate in the potential spread.

These CBD gummies new coming thru when I need to relax or have joint/body pain. There’s no THC so you don’t have to worry about being impaired. I don’t take them too often, but when I do need them

Ask all your questions at the consultation. 
Are they infected? Can it wait and be treated with antibiotics? 
I wouldn’t worry cross contamination. Risks are still very low.

Flatten the curve people! To those of you still out partying - don’t. Stay home and distance yourselves. You may be a carrier and not show any symptoms. #coronavirus  #COVID19 https:// medium.com/@tomaspueyo/co ronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca   …

Social distancing includes banning large gatherings unless you define 1 m radius circles on the floor, with one person per circle.   Heat measurements only work on those already showing symptoms. Doesn't catch it early enough.

You made me feel things again. After years of childhood abuse I completely shut down. Through years of therapy and healing I had found hope, but I still felt damaged. I couldn't quite love myself. You showed me the way, and I'll wait for you. #ArmyMissesBTS

Yes. Obama did nothing to fix the 2008 recession that got him elected.... And then wasted his political Goodwill on ObamaCare instead of universal healthcare... Mix the two: #coronavirus  is an economic depression: it terms of profits, deaths= lost customers. https:// twitter.com/CBSNews/status /1242999664045064192   …

Oh and you need to keep your family from getting infected as well. 

Each day you're not infected is a point. But you need to risk exposure for groceries, maybe some work, and other essential activities.

Each time you get exposed, you need to wash hands and isolate. You also

What #COVID19  has proven us until now: 

1. The poor will suffer firstly and the most. 

2. Healthcare is a basic human right that is why it must be granted worldwide for free.

4. Internet is a utility, not a luxury. 

5. Solidarity can help save lives.

I repaired my broken cooker, its safety valve was broken so I took my time and crafted out one from my erasing rubber.
It worked perfectly. I cooked Chole in it. They turn out to be tasty. #selfquarantine  #21daylockdown

1/2 However, general tips: 

Clarity of expectations -- this reduces anxiety. Children need to know what to expect. For us, this means a schedule. BUT, I am flexible w/it in reality.

Get outside - short walks or backyard play if at all possible really helps

Why is this a shock to the music industry? Yes, it’s going to hurt but so would seeing more people get sick. 

Plus promoters should be smart, curbing gatherings is part of social distancing plans. Take a look at the cruise industry, large gatherings are a risk.

No one can justify such henious crime. Nothing can. It has been a trend where people come up with human rights when there's a severe punishment served, but no one supports the victim. Yes we do have sentiments for the family of convicts, they didn't have a role but had to suffer.

1/ This is why I decided not to get tested for #COVID19 . I'm currently under self-isolation at home for 14 days after suspected exposure and having exhibited matching symptoms. The situation is rapidly developing, so information in this thread may become out of date. #pandemic
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:03:39
5/ If I take the test and have a positive result, by the time I tell everyone I've been in contact with that I have COVID-19, a calendar week has passed and they would likely already be exhibiting symptoms and already have passed it along to someone else.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:03:39
6/ But, if the result is negative, I can't rely on it since it could be a false negative. So, I have to assume I have COVID-19 regardless of the test result, which means there's no utility in taking the test, especially given that I can treat my symptoms without medical care.

To be 100% clear, if widely-available, accurate testing was available (eg. South Korea) I would not hesitate to get tested. It’s the lack of clarity around who has the disease by the unavailability of testing and the risk to more vulnerable individuals that forces this situation.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 09:08:50
Yes, that’s correct. So it’s a minimum of 14 days at this point until we know more. For example, it’s not well-understood how long people stay contagious. But yes, 14 days of self-isolation post any symptoms is the guidance currently.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 13:54:21
I think mild symptoms is the ticket, because they can be confused with other illness and thus the individual doesn’t understand the severity of what they may be passing on to others. Eg. In my situation I have very mild symptoms, but...  https:// twitter.com/alexmensch/sta tus/1238601642485800960?s=21   … https:// twitter.com/alexmensch/sta tus/1238601642485800960   …

Maddow is 100% correct on this

trump is responsible for the millions of deaths that will come from his utter incompetent and dishonest presidency

Older people are deathly afraid of other people & look terror stricken on seeing anyone under age 60 at the grocery store. I wonder if they will ever trust the younger generations again?

Today panic is definitely a thing. I'm not understanding why our state is allowing thousands of people from hot states a day to enter our state by plane, train and state to state bus travel. But residents in certain counties only are on lock down. What the actual fuck?

I'm being extra cautious because I spent the last few months taking care of my parents - which had me in and out of dr offices, hospitals & pharmacies frequently. I chose to self quarantine last week, for at least the 14 day period given those are high risk areas.

Could you imagine sitting home & saying a name and *poof* Lee Seung-gi shows up. I don't think I would stop saying his name. Although there are few others I wouldn't be mad if they showed up.

I’m so glad it has helped you. I’m here if you need 2 chat. I have anxiety, COPD & CPTSD & don’t fair well w/ isolation, so I can relate. I spoke with my GP & felt a lot better afterward. She was really open & honest w/ me about the virus & my risks. Have you spoken to your GP?

I think they should give saitama an honest to goodness equally matched villain in the form of a primordial eldritch god who is purely evil. Its immortal to the max and it causes saitama to feel pain for the first time in years. He basically unlocks his own hidden memories1/4

My thought is:

Injury at home = likely one ambulance. Quick turnaround (locaction deprnding).

Injury on a remote crag or ravine = ambulance + possibly air ambulance and mountain rescue if very remote.

Not to mention the risk of RTC en route.

The problem is that people are most contagious before they show symptoms. Also this virus is airborne meaning that it can linger. Think about how you can smell cigarette or pot smoke a while after someone left a place... #StayTheFHome

(1/?) currently in self-isolation. Not because I have #COVID19  but because I share many similar symptoms of the virus. Dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, chest pains, etc. I understand that if you have these symptoms you should call 811. HOWEVER, when you call that... #COVIDalberta

(3/?) so I call my doctor and she asks me some questions. She diagnose me as having the flu? And says I don’t need a #COVID19  test. Okay 1. I’ve had the flu, I know this isn’t the flu 2. How am I supposed to trust a diagnosis based over the phone?... #COVIDalberta

(4/?) Now I’m no doctor, but I must be honest and think this isn’t the best way to do this. Also since I do show similar symptoms to #COVID19  I must go into #SelfIsolation  for 2 weeks as instructed by my employer/company. #COVIDalberta

That’s why a lockdown should be implemented with solutions for people who would be affected by it the most . They shouldn’t have to starve but they also shouldn’t be left to be exposed to the risk or become the risk.

He's not social distancing in fact he's being Mr. Goody helping his neighbors during the #COVID19  crisis. If I have to endure my trauma doing the right thing with isolation why should I have to worry he's bringing in the disease to me and my mother. He's risking our health.

First, I found my purpose and I used that to justify being out. I wanted to help other people, connect them to resources, gathered supplies for them, etc. Now, I just can't justify it because going out poses a risk for my mother not just for myself. It I was alone I'd be out.

 Is there a graver threat?
 Is MSM trying to destroy America?
 Is Pharma panicked?
 Does America value Grandma? Grandpa?
 Medicare/Medicaid poor reimbursement gap causes staff shortages

Yes. And still isolate because positive can show up days later. That is how S. Korea has successfully contained the illness.

Example: parking lot of my nursing home has been hugely silent 4 weeks. Normally NONSTOP activity. ALL activity is inside now. Instead, we have neighbors creating chalk art and waving at us inside. 
 Wouldn’t we rather extra precautions taking place in unhit areas? 
No panic. E

Do you’all understand what #COVID19  EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS & INFECTION CONTROL means? 
-Drastic measures to halt a proven virus that re-infects & has zero immunity 
-A deadly virus to a specific population w/unusual pre-to-post virus shed time

COVID19 ER PREPAREDNESS & INFECTION CONTROL:
-The reason there are 20+ nursing home outbreaks in Seattle is because ONE nursing home at the epicenter did NOT send up SOS
-Infection Prevention & Control means ALL HANDS ON DECK & PREPARE

Do not let your depression wish deaths on those you have not met. Do not let your depression assume we all want to die young. Face you fears and use your horns, but never do harm for the sake of pretending your view on death is healthy or universal

I've watched a family member die slowly and painfully of Alzheimer's at age 47.

I've seen a family member die rather quickly of infection at 94.

How old is too old?

Death and its length is unpredictable. Do not let your fear of pain control your feelings towards the old.

Most patients can be confirmed with COVID19 within first 3 days, is very unlikely they will show symptoms after 14 days. China not only does the test kit but also takes a radiography of patient’s lungs. Therefore, you should be healthy in test and radiography to be released

You are confused. People get infected and may take til 27 days to show symptoms. Most will show symptoms within 3 days of infection, depends of the person and their inmune system. This case is more like ‘Thypoid Mary’, a person who will not show symptoms but can infect others

To me is hard to believe. I work in a geochemistry lab, so I know how obsessed they are in labs. And I love Chinese, but after 2 years of living here I’m almost vegetarian for the way they keep meat, specially in some rural areas. Gov can’t control old people and their traditions

# Coronavirus  8 provinces-level regions (including Shanghai) have no new cases of #COVID19  since Thursday. Recovery rate has also surpassed new infections rate in all China (excluding Hubei). Outbreak may be over by April.
However, spillovers include inflation and airlines fares

The US pandemic will be called "American virus", "cowboy virus", "trump virus" or similar.

Americans will remain global outcasts for a long time, even once the virus is under control.

It will be a generation before the US will be entrusted with any global leadership role again.

Definitely not a well designed question. Sorting the data will be a nightmare. Of course that assumes they care about anything beyond the initial "white" response, and the rest is just to placate people who don't like identifying "white" as an ethnicity.

Also, lots of evidence that you don't need to have symptoms to transmit. 

But definitely folks who are sick should *not* be in class. Even if it is "just" a cold. I would say something that gives anyone feeling unwell permission to leave rather than calling out individuals.

A productive start to Week 2 of #selfquarantine  : Cleaned the whole house (including bathroom), changed bed linens, did three loads of laundry, mixed up home made #handsanitizer  (aloe vera gel + rubbing alcohol), AND assembled the climbing rose arbor we ordered from #wayfair  ! pic.twitter.com/j8wv1AKjRY

I liked the soundtrack. Also, at one point, Thor and the villain jump between several realms during the final fight and Benicio Del Toro shows up in the end. That was cool. Also, it was the first time I liked Loki as a character. I liked the one line:

"Possibly."

Takes a lot of tact and confidence

He obviously knows about trump's serious mental illness and treats him accordingly

This is how people outside Paris view Parisians :) There is a unique kind of urban privilege panic that comes from having all of your needs met at the push of an app. I think urban people are more resilient than they realize, but they haven't had a chance to test themselves.

And, ironically, I know I'm resilient because I was raised by parents with rural experience. My father's people came through the Dust Bowl. My mother's people survived the Great Depression. And we lived in rural eastern PA. So the city? Pfffft. I know how to make bread & beans.

If someone is high risk, you should treat them regardless of their symptoms. They'll be in the hospital getting treated regardless, but if someone is low risk and will be going back out into the community & not being admitted to the hospital, those are the ones that need testing.

My older son is always with me but his 13 yo brother goes to his dad’s a few days a month and I’m trying to figure out what to do as their dad’s a pilot and just brought a full flight of stranded Canadians back from Japan. I have asthma so seems like a big risk.

And that's why I'm so damn curious, 57% recovery rate is pretty huge compared too our 16% 
And we are only 195 ppl less as confirmed cases + considering population wise BC has approx. 1M more ppl then us and even being  "ground zero" you'd think it would be worse there, no?

Day 33. Moments when the shifu makes me think in the Chapulín Colorado. Is all cool, and then just randomly sprays chlorine around, alcohol spray in your hands or yells at you in Chinese. And me and the shifu lady stares at each other and him in confusion #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/jOL08hCqKd

Recovered patients testing positive not equal to #coronavirus  revival. Patients don’t renewed symptoms, and don’t infect others (after negative testing of close contacts) @who  #China

Well that was tougher than I imagined (long time since high school!), but after a bit of head scratching I landed on these few albums as ‘representative’ of my year 12: The Cure - The Head on the Door; Hoodoo Gurus - Mars Needs Guitars; and probably The Cult - Love

Terrific read, Frank. I’d read McQueen’s piece recently, you do great justice to his and others’ work. Really interesting to note Humphrey’s description of states breaking their own way re border control, quarantines, in light of what we’re seeing now with the ‘national cabinet’.

Most Americans are not afraid. In fact, states are complaining that people won’t follow “stay at home” orders.

That's the thing, I know many people who don't even have that spare. But that also doesn't help these high risk people now so it's pointless suggesting they do that unless you have a tardis spare so people can go back and save for a pandemic noone expected

Today it was beautiful out so I decided to go to the lake near my house for a short walk. When I drove down there was an alarming amount of people walking/running/biking etc. but instead of giving into my anxiety, I stayed in my car with sunroof open and drove along the lake.

2. Use hand sanitizer that has 60% alcohol content or more (I don’t use it, and I’m not sure what people are fully saying about alcohol content % numbers. Check accredited resources). Remember, hand washing is your best bet. Hand sanitizer is a good pick-me-up in between.

6. Stay home if you feel any type of symptoms. From the lowest grade fever, to the “maybe it’s just allergies” sniffles, the best thing you can do is stay home. Drink plenty of fluids, stay warm, and get as much rest as possible. Read some books, watch some movies. Stay home!

Still not overwhelmed. In most countries, you don't get tested unless you have strong symptoms, to avoid rush on hospitals.  The 4 days wait would still indicate that there'd be a rush if those symptoms became serious.  They could test more here, but same true elsewhere.

I wouldn’t go. His age makes him a higher risk. If he contracts it, he would be considered high risk. He should be self isolating already. And considering that the US’s testing criteria is still out dated due to lack of test kits, you could be a non-symptomatic carrier.

Many people can't just book time off work. They may have used all their time off and would risk being sacked if they called in sick, there are loads of reasons people can't give up their life aaaaand now I'm unfollowing you.

However, we have to take other things into account and look at the bigger picture when discussing testing too, because in Japan, if you have flu symptoms you go to the ENT, do the unpleasant swab test and find out if you have flu strain A or B. This is unheard of in Australia. 3/

I did this for a few days before obvious symptoms started, but I may not have started soon enough because a couple of times in the last two days I’ve seen my temp briefly (only in the middle of the night) go lower than what I thought my baseline was.

So -find your baseline.

More importantly, so that you know if fever is actually GONE or not since it’s supposed to be gone 3 days before you unquarantine.

Shes very lucky  My parents work in the hospitals w/ covid patients and they're out of absolutely everything. My  father is high risk and I'm super worried. hospitals are begging for supplies and hand sewn masks. They've been wearing trash bag gowns and the same mask for weeks.

Azithromycin is a pretty powerful antibiotic. Hydroxychloroquine can be harsh on the patient. As an immunosuppressant, could further put the patient at risk for other diseases that lurk about.

Can you not read polls? 

Why are rightwingers so lacking mentally? They ALL are...can't spell, can't read polls, can't find legitimate sources, can't see the lies that trump spews daily

It is tragic, really, and they are allowed to breed, which is a really dangerous thing.

He needs a ten-hour delay on his mouth/tweets/ass (they are all the same)

He thinks out loud (like toddlers do) and gets the world freaking out and then he changes his mind, denying he ever said the thing that freaked everyone out

And think of how terrifying it is, being in a room. with the medical staff in those protective outfits and other people in the process of dying

Geeze, a true nightmare

trump should be hung by his toes for his lack of management of this tragedy

Many white Americans who were comfortable until the pandemic hit can only cope with one of those things and deny or minimize the other.

Tuesday was day 13 of my #SelfIsolation , #SelfQuarantine  because of my #COVID19  symptoms...  no fever for a couple of days now, and that’s great! No cough, no headache and feeling better all around... I spent the day moving from one hotel to another, n that wore me out. Ugh!

Anxiety over the unknown is creeping in. How are you handling your anxiety? It’s hard to find people to talk to about it when everyone is on lockdown. I’m thinking a video chat with a good friend might help. What’s helping you?

I’ve kind of always seen this as one of the caveats of owning a business. High risk/high reward so to speak. If you’re on the up, you take a £20k dividend but if not you get nothing. It’s the risk you take in running your own business, especially as a Ltd company of 1.

I’m no scientist or doctor, but if you’re most contagious BEFORE you show symptoms, how is this helping the prevention of community spread? In addition, what’s to say someone won’t pop a couple Tylenol’s and be symptoms free by the time they get to the train station?!

Plus the NHS recommends a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise a week, which is roughly 21 minutes a day. People don't need to go crazy, just enough exercise to not suffer detrimental effects from no exercise at all. People would be surprised at how much we do without realising.

With Dominic Cummings self isolating with symptoms of coronavirus and the heath secretary testing positive. How many more members of your cabinet has to self isolate or be tested? (Before NHS staff I might add) 
How many people have you infected?

They prefer them down-trodden and dependent on the government-much easier to control!

You shouldn't worry. In those type situations you need to numb yourself to it, or you will go insane, or get super depressed. It won't last long after, when things get better. You will still feel emotions, you may have to remind yourself that it's okay to do so.

I’m already home bound, due to my mental health. My parents are 65 and 68 (69 in June). Rest assured, I am taking care of them, making sure nobody comes into our home who can put them at risk, and finding ways to keep us stocked on necessities.

Sleep. I know it sounds so obvious, but I had symptoms and stayed in bed as much as possible for four days. The breathing got better then relapsed again and I needed to sleep more. And LOTS of water!!

It’s not irresponsible at all. If you’ve got the symptoms, you’ve most likely have it and you should treat it as if you do and self isolate. No testing means there’s no way of knowing. There are loads of people who have it, that’s the nature of the virus.

No need for testing more if people follow the guidelines.  Currently, only testing those with high risk + symptoms as false negatives lead to people breaking quarantine. Best that anyone sick views themselves as positive and stays at home!  Tests are done on arrival in Narita.

Well, if you actually need to be out of the house for an “essential” reason, then you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. I’m talking about the people who are going out, just to be out, without any regard for other people’s safety.

Obviously putting someone in jail could put many people at risk. While it is unfortunate that so many people have no source of income at the moment, maybe one should consider that before they choose to be reckless and ignore safety precautions because “they’re not worried”

Half my anxiety is caused by the rapid proliferation of COVID in NY.
The other half, by my parents who keep sending me Yoga videos.They believe it’s the only COVID cure we have.
Ivanka should have been my parents’ daughter. They’d bond over this alchemy. https:// twitter.com/IvankaTrump/st atus/1244944668057571330   …

Andrew Yang is from a generation that believes in an “American Dream” tax, where you believe enduring some racism is a debt you must pay to be a part of America.

Completely agree. My daughter is autistic and it’s only since her diagnosis have I clicked that I am too as we have similar traits. I love her more than anything but it’s tough day to day - like you said, unless you know you don’t know.

The type of pain does not matter; the important thing is that the pain experienced is unpleasant. Because anger never occurs in isolation but rather is necessarily preceded by painful feelings, it is often characterized as a ''secondhand'' emotion.

The only possible good that may come out of this disaster is that may shine a light on just how terrible they are, and show those citizens who didn't know or didn't want to know just how little these politicians care for the public they were elected to serve.
