Practice good health habits: wash hands for at least 20 secs w/ soap, cover your mouth when you cough, and if you have symptoms of #COVID19  STAY HOME (do NOT go to school or work) and immediately contact your healthcare provider. If you don’t have/can’t afford a doctor, call 211.

There is absolutely no need for this much toilet paper, at all. We have a household of 3 people. Two weeks ago I bought our usual 24 pack of toilet paper which lasts us a month. The only reason to stock pile is for isolation purposes. Buy a family pack and that's it. Selfish.

(2/2) Variables for everyone, immune system and overall health. Age is a factor but - if a person is healthy the risks are always reduced. If you can self quarantine/isolate since the key is avoidance. This will pass but it will take time. I'm going back into self isolation..

This is the next worry - casual and non professional workers will be hit the hardest around the world.  It’s easy to see airlines cutting flights, museums closing, for example, but this puts a lot of people out of work or on reduced wages.

Was feeling like such hot shit today as I walked into class and as I sat down I opened my Topo Chico and it sprayed all over myself and the desk. When I say I was soaked I mean SOAKED. I just pretended nothing happened and sat there literally dripping for 45 minutes LMAOOOOO pic.twitter.com/BMtTCO2Hs8

That's ok. This issue is self-correcting. At least on a ship you can only infect each other and you are not inconveniencing anyone but yourselves if you end up quarantined.

“Healthy” people can carry the virus for up to 14 days before showing symptoms.  That whole time they are spreading it. Just using wipes isn’t enough. It’s not alarmist to encourage people to stay home. At this point it’s necessary. Our hospitals can’t handle the patient volume.

People have PhDs in understanding how viruses spread. Of course no one wants that, but without precautions we have to plan for the worst. If everyone gets infected within weeks, people will die bc we literally don’t have enough equipment. That’s the fear. Not the virus itself.
-6
itsme_allisonp
2020-03-15 12:26:24
Without precautions, yes in the US. The virus itself isnt all that more deadly than other viruses - as evidenced by the .6% death rate in S. Korea. But again, people won’t be able to access the care they need. Thousands of additional ppl will need already occupied hospital beds.

My daughter is sick w/corona like symptoms. Neg on flu+strep tests. They refuse to test her for corona because she doesn’t meet the “criteria”. We have 1 confirmed, possibly 3 cases in town. So how do I know if she is a spreader? #coronavirus  #coronavirusnj  @77WABCradio  #cdcfail

And I’m not a “cis” woman. I’m a woman. Cis means nothing. It’s a term coined in the 90’s by a sexual deviant and it has no legitimacy in our society.  https://www. nationalreview.com/2014/05/cis-ri diculous-christine-sisto/   … pic.twitter.com/s2IZtAxPhD

During his political career he did hurt a lot of #LGBTQ  people. He didn’t support a community he’d eventually be a part of. But we’ve all been there in one way or another. Denial is often the easiest & most dangerous form of self hatred we take on. For that I forgive him.

Coming off the heels of #InternationalWomensDay , I had quite the experience this morning...

I was approached by someone (spoiler: an old, white man) in the gym while wearing this shirt. He apparently had some feelings about it. Here’s how that convo went...

I was just relistening to that podcast and he also pointed out that 38% of nurses in the U.S. have kids in school, so by shutting down schools, we're putting ourselves at a huge risk of being understaffed in hospitals. Thought that was an interesting, albeit nerve-wracking point

This is consistent - since the PM is in self-isolation and showing no signs there is no value in testing specifically for the reasons in the article. There is a significant chance of providing a false negative since it takes days for the virus to duplicate itself.

First of all don't panic.. You're young and strong and having high immunity power. So virus can't harm much, you will be ok .It may be simple flu or body aching due to cold. Get tested in hospital asap. Don't panic... It's just a case of flu or might be cold. Use soap!!

Question- do people of lower income see a dentist?  I think due to health issues - it might be an idea to have it paid for- or is there a program already?  What about Dalhousie dental school?
I have a private Blue Cross dental plan- it only pays for general dentistry.

Hence, while it is less deadly than Ebola, the high infection rate means it is likely to be more devastating in terms of global deaths, especially if it gets out in underserved communities.  Note we think death rate on par with Spanish Flu despite antiviral drugs.

According to the outbreak map, the #covid19  #coronavirus  is almost surrounding Kentucky. That means, to me, it's already here, just not evident. What I mean is, someone in this state is already infected, they just haven't been tested, or are not showing symptoms. Yay

The way elections work in Kentucky are: the cities of Louisville, Lexington, and Frankfort almost always vote blue. The rural areas, along w/bowling Green, Florence, and Owensboro tend to vote red. Idk if it's the bullshit mitch slings, or they hate his opponents

Everything’s still totally normal down here. It’s pretty surreal. I’m the only one wearing gloves and wiping things down with Lysol. We’re taking precautions, not touching face and of course frequent hand washing & sanitizing. No crowds = lots of space for social distancing.

Even if most realize not literally everything* is shutting down, NV and (a lot of)employment in NV is pretty much grinding to a halt for 30 days! 

And you’re asking why everyone is freaking?

If one has the patience to recognize it. Unfortunately most folks in the MMA bubble, learned/casual alike, don't. We aren't as prone to impulsive anger because we've seen similar instances transpire before. Maybe not EXACTLY like what Yoel Romero did. But familiar. #UFC248

Something over the YEARS that never fails to amuse me is how MMA (UFC) fans gripe about the money they spent to attend or watch a card on PPV at home all cuz ONE fight or 2 turned out poorly. Not saying they can't feel that way. It's just the lack of perspective. #UFC248

The hashtags #DemExit2020  and #WriteinBernie  show a real lack of understanding of how our democracy works. A symbolic, idealistic vote will do nothing to change reality. If you want the DNC to change or another candidate to win you have to get off your ass and change some minds.

I understand that position emotionally - I don't see it being effective in reality. It is pretty clear a lot of democrats are uncomfortable with Bernie. The media and the DNC may have great influence, but if people overwhelmingly wanted Bernie they couldn't have stopped us.

The problem is the sheer number of tests to be reviewed which is not going well in the states.....you need say 40 or so per team.

Thoughts on Self-Isolation...

If you travel and need the government to tell you to self-isolate then you are a moron.

This is up to you and not the government. Be smart and be kind to your fellow persons.  Sit at home for 2 weeks and stop whining.

Port city folx who have not put themselves in isolation for two weeks already should not share opinions on how non-port city folx, who are not in your stage of the pandemic, are having a final moment outside before likely a month in isolation as it spreads across the country.

Non-port cities are shutting down before deaths & overflowing hospitals, which is amazing, but also means 4-8 weeks of isolation for it to really work as it spreads across the US. Keep that in mind when major cities re-open like everything’s fine & leave others behind. #COVID19

Also an important thing to do is wipe off your cellphone with Lysol wipes after you been out because cell phones putting them down on counters and other surfaces collect germs and you put it to your mouth good tip from @DrOz   I also think cans of pop or beer best to put in glass.

Today I helped my student by being in her International Women’s Day performance and she gave me a rose as a thank you.

Kindness, gratitude and building each other up are essential in the fight against the patriarchy.

Those of us currently living among elderly family member have no choice but to self-isolate.

I'd rather be mildly inconvenienced stuck at home all day every day for 2-6 weeks, than have to live with the guilt of getting them so sick they could die.

Day 1 feels a little strange. I woke up before my "alarm". Felt a bit of anxiety like I'm doing something wrong by staying home. No message from the boss.  Shopped & cleaned last night, paid bills before 8am this morning. Hmm...what next. There's always design and group texts!

That's worse than the Great Depression, which was about 25% unemployment and 30% drop in GDP.  But Great Depression was causing by economic failure and this is medical/health related so not sure how equal the comparison can be.

Might socialize among themselves but still in contact with population afterwards. Should lockdown for this initial surge of virus but worry is later resurgence. This isn't going to be done and probably endemic. But for the moment best to isolate and deal with other factors later

Kamala comes from a Blue state, so that is the only disadvantage...that is usually about the only thing a VP can do to change the election is possibly give them the state that they may not have won. We need Stacy Abram's state, but Stacy is totally unqualified for so many reasons

trump MUST be charged with manslaughter for every death that occurs because of his greedy &  ruthless lack of leadership

His refusal to use WHO tests will lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of people & jobs

Yes, thanks to trump and his greedy grubby desire to delay the WHO tests until he could figure out how to make money from it

Every single death and economic disaster is on his back

He is worse than any virus, he IS a virus

Everything trump touches dies or wishes it were dead

It clearly shows what a total & complete narcissistic asshole trump is

He has ZERO credibility due to is 18,000 lies in office

I expect to see a significant increase in infection and death here in #Canada  from #Covid19  ... The snowbirds are returning home. This annual migration are mostly retired elderly who spend winter in Florida. The most at risk of death from this virus.

# Canada  and #Covid19  ...As the elderly Snowbirds return to #Québec  from the #USA  they will merge with their communities. "Hang around with people their own age." Both them and their friends are of the highest risk of death. Expect the death toll to rise.

If everyone self quarantined for 14 days it would sort it right out. Completely lock us down. It will be hard but it's better than months of uncertainty.

One of Jordan's biggest games is the flu game. Athletes have had the flu before and bounced back. 1 NBA player got the Coronavirus and the league shut down.  Jokes are cool but downplay this virus.

 Imagine you have money.

And universal healthcare,
so you don’t have to die.

Imagine you have food,
while quarantined alone.
No fear of losing housing,
& your job, your car, your phone.

Day 2 of self-isolation: standing on my step stool in various areas of my apartment imagining what it's like to live like a tall. The tops of things are very dirty :/

Amidst all the craziness the world is feeling, your fear and panic is not an excuse to fuel underlying racist and xenophobic thoughts that ultimately turn into subtle yet noticeable actions and comments. #IamNotAVirus

He shouldn’t have said that he doesn’t care if he dies from Covid19 coz he’s out & about. If the leader dies, there’ll be more disorder. He might also encourage the impressionable few to have the “que sera sera attitude” to just go out when we need them to stay home

@ yasminv  u asked today abt silver linings, here's mine. I managed 2 get a 45 rolls box of TP at my local Sam's Club, I live alone, I don't need that many. I opened the box in the parking lot & gave away over half of it 2 elder ppl heading 2 the store, it felt good 2 do something.

Business and home I should add incase that caused confusion   we ran a pub and lived above it so in emergency acc. Living room kitchen all in same room (not complaining as we have a roof over our heads) but hard to keep distance between. We will find a way  x

Day 1 of self-isolation: kids have read their books, youngest is trying to eat every last bit of food in the house (the unhealthy kind of course), constant "turn it down, stop shouting, play nice" and now I'm wondering if it's too early for wine? #selfquarantine  #coronavirus

1
ct_la
2020-03-15 15:34:35
Same. 

It's like the mental stress of not having control over their daily lives the way they used to have is far more anxiety-inducing than the virus itself.

For that reason, I have little desire to be around people right now, even if I could be. Not much I can do for them.

2020-03-15 15:38:29
This is precisely why I think we'll have to shut down everything in the US to get this outbreak under control. Way too many people who can't be arsed to do the right thing.

I know that would suck badly for drivers.

if you start the week on a good note, the rest of the week will follow suit. it's important that you remain focused on your goals & objectives despite any setbacks you may suffer along the way. it's easy to give up, but you gotta keep persevering. you'll get there in the end

There's so many talented photographers out there who have the technical skills to take a great photo. But I feel they lack a strong story to connect us to the work. I don't want to see 10 shots at the same angle with different poses. I think we lack editing and curating skills.

Holy crap the latest death in Alberta was at the McKenize Towne continuing health centre and 1 staff, 2 residents confirmed with 11 others showing symptoms. This hit home, my grandma was thinking about moving in there and it's a quick drive from my house. Yeash kinda feel

I did receive a travel warning from the US Consulate in Bermuda. Hopefully that helps keep the visitor numbers down. I don’t see many visitors on this plane. Maybe a few.

We provided our names and contact details. You also provide travel details and list any present symptoms (if any). We had to sign at the bottom and agree that what we filled out is true.

My 79-y/o mother went out for coffee on Weds (say inside), hairdressers Thurs, & to a garage to get 2 tyres changed Fri. She screams at me, a PwDs, to self-isolate bc she remembers what it was like to see me nearly die of a chest infection, yet she won't stay in.

What type of screening? Health: nothing. A piece of paper at paris airport. We went through passport control within minutes. No questions. TsA screen per usual, more concern about the 1 liter bottle of brandy from duty free. In Egypt, they were at least taking temps.

Thinking about the people wearing face masks at CDG airport. Many coughed/ sneezed without covering their mouth. 1 boy was pulling his mask down to sneeze (no covering mouth). We tried our best to keep distance from others. In US, hardly any masks & no distances. #Airport pic.twitter.com/T3AFdx8Qqs  – at  Aéroport Paris-Charles de Gaulle (CDG)

Seriously though, only in America is there such a bad stigma on wearing face masks. Some of my teammates at Sephora (where I work full-time) decided to start wearing face masks (and gloves for me bc my dermatitis flared up on my hands) bc shoppers just have no damn wherewithal+

You state didn’t declare an emergency yet, did it? Wisconsin declares it last week Thursday. I’m also high-risk w/ a preexisting heart condition. In addition to Sephora closing doors earlier this week, I also had to close down my private beauty studio where I do lashes & makeup.

Check on your friends with depression or any other mental illness. No having anything to do and being cooped up inside all the time can make their symptoms a lot worse.

If Trump gets 4 more years that is not my fault.  I went down this path in 2016 when I did vote for Hillary and got Trump. So if the definition of crazy is doing the same thing and expecting different results  - why would I do this same thing in 2020?

Bridgewater is a top guy IMO. He at one point was what Mahomes is now before he got injured. He also showed last season when Brees was hurt that he can still run an offense in a significant way. He probably becomes a top 15 QB given a starter role.

After nearly losing my brother last year this thought terrifies me.

Tonight I'm scared, & sad.

Day 3 of #selfquarantine  
I was playing call of duty while taking a break & I learned two things
1. I can kill another player with a flashbang after damaging them to near-death 
2. Preteenage boys will yell at the top of their lungs "FUCK YOU" when you kill them with a flashbang

Seeing productions shut down hurts my heart in a strange way because of my upbringing. I was badly bullied by kids and adults alike. I was called a liar for reporting people who physically assaulted me during class. 

But Mum would call me in sick and bring me on set... 1/

Productions down is the RIGHT THING TO DO. Please don't misunderstand me. But, it's also really tough on the crew members, especially, who have been pushing hard for 14-18 hour days with short turnaround times between days/nights to earn a living and care for their families... 3/

Was accused of being scared of leaving my building despite not being immunocompromised when I said #SocialDistancing  & #selfquarantine  were why I can’t meet up to return something they needed. Please let’s all be respectful, patient, & kind. It’s hard enough already #Covid_19
2
SChenRN
2020-03-18 19:15:13
Also #SocialDistancing  has to do with limiting spread and #flatteningthecurve . It’s to protect public health of all esp. since we have limited tests and #selfquarantine  is currently the rec for most with mild symptoms. #COVID2019  #publichealth  #PublicSafety  #PracticeWhatYouPreach
2
SChenRN
2020-03-19 05:28:44
Due to recent fever, current cough, and lack of access to #Covid_19  testing in my area, the current rec is still to self-quarantine for 14 days which is slightly different than practicing social isolation for asymptomatic, healthy individuals.

I just scared the seven bells of hell out of a new & super cute bank teller@my branch. Arrived in the lobby & said hello, please take my money. She smiled & said Ok,  asked how my day was going. I said I just bought my quarantine booze, as I'm now on the watch clock. Facepalm.

Bananas
Rice
Apples
Toast

They're easily digestible and cheap. Peanut butter & ramen are also easy to keep down

Was frustrated coz when we called our provider, they don’t want to test him; said must be a flu. I think it’s because there aren’t enough testing kits & he’s young-ish. I have to fight him just to take his temp   but my worry is that he’ll harm others if he’s a carrier #COVID19

She also said that it was depressing yesterday coz she had to let go of her restaurant staff as their manager & she was told to do so. Today, she called me crying because she was let go, too. She has 3 kids. She’s scared that she might lose her new home.  #COVID19

Kara, If we can set up burning man in a few days & various agencies can do refugee camps - we can set up isolation centers. 

The US military has exercises called strong angel to house tens of thousands of people in case of pandemic or, then, fear of a dirty bomb. It can be done

Day 3 of quarantine: still no test. I have an underlying condition which could kill me. Blindly over treating it to not die. Wellness check starts today, alerts people if you don't answer the phone. Forgot to turn off my work alarm. Up at 4

Day 3 part 2: Free service through April from @iamfine  they will call you and if they can't reach you, they alert the people you entered in your profile. Great if you live alone. FREE. Could save a life.

From an introvert that tries to squash anxiety before it comes, one thing that helps is to do the family cloth thing (washable cloths) instead of toilet paper.

You made me feel things again. After years of childhood abuse I completely shut down. Through years of therapy and healing I had found hope, but I still felt damaged. I couldn't quite love myself. You showed me the way, and I'll wait for you. #ArmyMissesBTS

Quarantining means staying home and away from other people as much as possible for that 14-day period. People in this circumstance who don't live alone should do their best to retreat to their room or find a separate area in their home.

What's happening right now is the Herber Hoover effect. Hoover was blamed for the Depression, even though Hoover shouldn't have been. In Trump's case, he's not completely innocent on this, but sadly he didn't play his cards right and choose the incorrect people to handle it.

+1 to both. If there's no hot bag, then put some lamp over the box. Dry thick clothes, or woolen stuff and it will snuggle in. Keep some boiled chicken (if possible) or boiled egg and water near the box. And let it settle down, explore on its own.

These numbers are basically from a computer program that gives us the absolute worst possibility and it would mean that we are doing absolutely nothing to combat the virus in terms of social distancing, testing, and vaccine trials

Update: 
Day 3 in self isolation. 
Bad cough. 
Bad headache
Temp 37.0•C 
Bad congestion. Has gone even worst. Can not breath through my nose at all. 

Feeling a lot worst then yesterday. But still confident it’s just a normal cold. #COVIDー19  #lockusdown  #StayHome  #StayTheFHome

I’d like for my friends in #Kosovo  to read this article. Kosovo doesn’t have a case of #COVID19  yet but safety measures must be taken as quickly as possible.

What #COVID19  has proven us until now: 

1. The poor will suffer firstly and the most. 

2. Healthcare is a basic human right that is why it must be granted worldwide for free.

3. Life > Money

4. Internet is a utility, not a luxury. 

5. Solidarity can help save lives.

While for some us the #quarantine  can serve as a way to get more work done, read, translate, watch movies, spend quality time with loved ones etc., for people struggling with depression, anxiety and other mental conditions, this period can be very challenging.

1/2 However, general tips: 

Clarity of expectations -- this reduces anxiety. Children need to know what to expect. For us, this means a schedule. BUT, I am flexible w/it in reality.

Get outside - short walks or backyard play if at all possible really helps
3
IndieJenFischer
2020-03-17 03:53:58
Last tip -- probably the most essential for us: 

Daily Quiet Time. This is a requirement in our house. They must lie down without reading, talking, etc. for 15 minutes. EVERYDAY (beginning Friday) that we've done this, my children (8 and 10 well past nap age) have fallen asleep!

I know it’s something incredibly stupid to be upset about but, I’ve misplaced a piece of fancy Belgian chocolate   that I bought today. I can’t find it anywhere in my kitchen or living room, and it definitely made it out of the grocery bag earlier. I’m close to tears over this.

Taking care of the patients is exhausting yes but the greatest stress has been the lack of supplies. Since we were first in country fighting this then my prayer is you will have plenty of PPE.

Why is this a shock to the music industry? Yes, it’s going to hurt but so would seeing more people get sick. 

Plus promoters should be smart, curbing gatherings is part of social distancing plans. Take a look at the cruise industry, large gatherings are a risk.

1/ This is why I decided not to get tested for #COVID19 . I'm currently under self-isolation at home for 14 days after suspected exposure and having exhibited matching symptoms. The situation is rapidly developing, so information in this thread may become out of date. #pandemic
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:03:38
3/ A couple points: (a) results take about a calendar week to get back to the patient; (b) the test is diagnostic in nature, and that means that false negative results are likely. The implication is that a negative result cannot be relied upon but a positive result is definitive.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:03:39
5/ If I take the test and have a positive result, by the time I tell everyone I've been in contact with that I have COVID-19, a calendar week has passed and they would likely already be exhibiting symptoms and already have passed it along to someone else.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:03:39
6/ But, if the result is negative, I can't rely on it since it could be a false negative. So, I have to assume I have COVID-19 regardless of the test result, which means there's no utility in taking the test, especially given that I can treat my symptoms without medical care.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:03:39
8/ Finally, since self-isolation is really a service to public health and those that are much more vulnerable to the virus, I also felt that I didn't want to take testing capacity away from those that need it more urgently than I do.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 07:51:45
Social distancing is key, and at least in the US, until widely available testing arrives, the best thing to do is bunker down:  https:// twitter.com/alexmensch/sta tus/1238601642485800960?s=21   … https:// twitter.com/alexmensch/sta tus/1238601642485800960   …
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 08:52:08
To be 100% clear, if widely-available, accurate testing was available (eg. South Korea) I would not hesitate to get tested. It’s the lack of clarity around who has the disease by the unavailability of testing and the risk to more vulnerable individuals that forces this situation.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 09:08:50
Yes, that’s correct. So it’s a minimum of 14 days at this point until we know more. For example, it’s not well-understood how long people stay contagious. But yes, 14 days of self-isolation post any symptoms is the guidance currently.

Day 4/ #covid  #quarantine  #selfisolating  What’s been most interesting about the spread of the virus (esp. now than I’m on self-isolation) is how people react to my situation. That alone reveals more about their character than any single situation I can recall.
3
alexmensch
2020-03-14 13:54:21
I think mild symptoms is the ticket, because they can be confused with other illness and thus the individual doesn’t understand the severity of what they may be passing on to others. Eg. In my situation I have very mild symptoms, but...  https:// twitter.com/alexmensch/sta tus/1238601642485800960?s=21   … https:// twitter.com/alexmensch/sta tus/1238601642485800960   …

The number of people on twitter I've seen who say they have #covid19  and are or were in the hospital or ICU for treatment is concerning.

Statistically this means nothing of course, but I also noted that none of them are elderly.

Adequate hospital capacity will make or break us.

Howdy all, I heard from the excellent people at @whitman_health  to clarify what is considered "heavily impacted". Short answer: there is no solid definition, given the fluid situation. They encourage self-isolation & social distancing whenever possible @wsupullman . #covid19

Update: Guidance from @whitman_health  is that travelers and others should self-isolate if possible. Nothing is mandated at this time, but if you are priveleged to be able to work from home you should do so. #COVID19  #COVID19seattle

Today I spoke to @whitman_health  for clarification. They encouraged me to promote self-isolation, working remotely, offering classes online ASAP, postponing events if possible. Nothing is mandated, but earlier actions help more. Just ask 1918. #COVID19 https://www. nytimes.com/2007/04/17/hea lth/17flu.html   …

Lee JoonGi will 4ever be my period hero. He has a special place in my heart, even tho I cussed the crap out of him during the finale of SHR. I was so upset at him at the end, but not as upset as I was w/ 8th prince. I haven’t forgiven him yet & refuse to watch his other dramas

Because there’s an association with lack of sleep and increased risk of heart problems and diabetes. Sleeping naked improves the hours you sleep for therefore preventing as much of a risk.

Anxiety hit me hard last night. It is important to be informed, aware. I am. My family is self-isolating and today I am taking a break. No social media, no news. I seek the connections available here, but also need to take some space. #selfcare  #QuarantineLife  #coronavirus

Can't say for certain, but I very much doubt it. I'm in Quarantine after travelling back to China. I've been tested twice. It's unlikely they would test me twice and not test people with symptoms.  Also, don't trust HK news about mainland China, it's rarely subjective or true

Yep. Same amount, presumably. Difference is in isolation there are now more people constantly at home who otherwise might use toilet paper elsewhere, like work & school. So more is needed in the household, even if same quantity more or less is used by each person. #COVID19Aus https:// twitter.com/AndrewYang/sta tus/1242128082301005824   …

Great question. This highlights the perverse logic of the current state of testing. Because I can't rely on a negative result, if I do end up needing medical attention in the future, I would let them know to assume I'm positive for the virus. That doesn't leave me any worse off.

Really worried about my boomer parents. I’m not in Pakistan and now I won’t even get a flight to get there. I might reach out to you when I need some help getting my parents to stay home like I really need them to properly self quarantine

This isolation is a piece of cake. I can.. 

- Drink as much wine as I please 
- Walk around naked
- Not care about my physical      presence alarming anyone
- Call my friends and family
- Not worry about my bf and dog conspiring to vote me out
- Pick my nose in peace https:// twitter.com/alsopeterbrown /status/1240710483369287683   …

I asked the would-be linebacker what he was doing? He said he was making a plan of attack. Now, I feel completely unsafe anywhere near this dude, and it has nothing to do with novel Coronavirus.

The little neighborhood shop where I buy dog food was busy. People are worried they will run out of pet food. Me, too. I ordered a bag of dog food but it won’t be here for more than a week. My dog has allergies. This is the only food she can eat.

New advice: Stay at home for 14 days if you or anyone in household has either a persistent cough or temperature.
Work from home and avoid social contact even if you have no symptoms. #covidー19uk

Today panic is definitely a thing. I'm not understanding why our state is allowing thousands of people from hot states a day to enter our state by plane, train and state to state bus travel. But residents in certain counties only are on lock down. What the actual fuck?

If we're treating those from new york, new jersey. The actual residents aren't going to have shit. I hate to have that local yokel attitude. But something isn't adding up. We are on lock down. But the potentially sick and exposed are coming here by the plane load every 20 minutes

Sometimes when you’ve put a lot of effort into training yourself to regulate emotions, an absence of big feelings at times they would previously have occurred can seem pretty weird...like being a little worried about the fact that you’re apparently not worried.

Strong evidence for canceling all conferences to *flatten the disease curve*. Particularly urgent in CA, WA, NY, and when individuals from those areas are participants.

A conference is pretty much the opposite of #SocialDistancing   |

By all means I've should have started self-isolation last week but I felt a duty to help people, so I took a risk; can't justify it any longer. Therefore, self-isolating until we go on lockdown soon. 10 weeks? Where did you get told 10 weeks from?

Good luck with it. I'm in Quarantine, in China, having returned here on Tuesday last. If I go outside, I could be facing 3 years in prison, my wife had to move to another apartment so I could be alone, or she would also be quarantined - now that's how it should be done. I approve

If this is true, then social distancing may not be the answer and isolation is. Get the cars off the road. I live in Zhongshan, China, we had virtually no cars and only 66 cases of Covid in three months - perhaps this is why. Good to know

Sometimes people ask me about my elementary school years but I have literally no memory of it, except for a few names... I wonder if I was so depressed that my brain didnt retain any of the memories or if I repressed those years in my memory so hard that they are just gone now

Day 5 of self-quarantined: Will reduce twitter to 2 times/day. Too much anxiety from it. I will also make a daily tiny ugly drawing starting tonight to make something productive out of those times. Cooking 3 meals per day, reading hours every evening and focus on remote work.

Day 6 Self Isolation. From Wales ...those who are saying they’re bored at home please remember there are people out there risking their lives to keep our country going. On another note when will the @WelshGovernment  sort testing out for frontline workers.

Right now testing frontline workers is crucial as many may wear PPE and already have the disease. Welsh Government are holding 1 press conference a week at present with little media coverage. The people of Wales need to see more from our Ministers.

Cause theyre supposed to call in to get a test kit. 211 told me to call the doctor’s only line. The doctor’s only line insisted I probably just have allergies and that even though my symptoms STARTED 12 days ago to get some tamiflu.... TAMIFLU ONLY WORKS IF YOU TAKE IT AT ONSET

Calm down. I know what an ER is. Emergency rooms are expensive, and I got laid off at the beginning of February. Who’s paying for an ER visit. Have you seen the cost of those without insurance? No. Thank. You. I saw a doctor today. Medicine in hand. Still no covid testing.

I think the biggest thing is that only symptoms can really be treated right now. I suspect the biggest change in the next 6 months will be lots more knowledge about the virus and disease which will inform treatment around the world. This thing isn’t ever really going away.

Overlap of WWI & 1918/19 pandemic was deadly as that flu strain killed mostly young adults, incl soldiers.

So info on flu severity/mortality was kept secret in WWI nations, which worsened death toll.

This quarantine is making it hard for me to stay san3
I'm alone 20 hours a day and I keep overthinking
I came to a point where I completely black out and hear voices
I'm afraid to stay alone and I feel revolted looking at my blank skin
I fidget a lot and find it Har to focus

It's the asymptomatic spread I'm the most worried about @RepMarkMeadows 

"About 60% of infected cases were estimated to be un-ascertained, i.e,. they scattered in the community and could infect others."

We absolutely should not panic, but we must take calm, rapid, and pro-active action to keep our communities healthy.

Nobody is getting clear guidance. I talked to @whitman_health  who told me that #SocialDistancing  is the most important thing we can do to slow #covid19  spread. Many ppl will have mild symptoms, but if the epidemic peaks fast hospitals will be overwhelmed.  |

Is there a way to report an individual who just arrived back home from an international trip down south who is not self isolating at all... They went to the work office (and who knows where else) right after returning to Canada.

They aren't even enforcing self isolation from international travellers. A man I know returned to NB last night from an international trip down south and has already been to his work office. Ridiculous.

How do you report someone? 811 had no info on reporting someone for refusal of isolation. RCMP just direct you to call 811. There is zero enforcement of this.

You go on your trip. You're exposed in a random gas station at a pump the person before you used was infected & contagious. 5-7 days later you are full blown contagious but not symptomatic. You spread it to every person you come in contact with. Some of those may die. #stayathome

Would like to be informed asap if this is the end of the world so that I can start really letting go and eating and drinking myself to death way before the plague claims me.

Except celebrities who test positive have likely come in contact with hundreds to thousands of fans within the past two weeks making a much larger segment of the population vulnerable to infection. So how about we test anyone whose showing symptoms?

@ IAGovernor : Please order shopping malls to close. They are unnecessary, do not encourage social distancing, & just changing hours ( ) does NOTHING. This is a crisis & businesses with large #'s of visitors (aside from grocery stores) need to be closed! #coronavirus  #COVID19

Yep. I was finally tested today & told only if my flu test was negative were they going to send in my COVID.

Dr said they're only sending in my COVID if flu test was negative, despite this someone shared w/ me:  https:// wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26 /6/20-0299_article   … 

Then he estimated 4-5 days.   He said they'd call yesterday if flu was positive. I didn't get a call, so either busy or moving forward w/ COVID.

People still Panic Buying for no reason. 
People not respecting the well-being of the vulnerable and the elderly.

I'll likely get torched for this, but I really think it would be best if we didn't normalize day drinking. We're at the *very* beginning of this crisis and it will spiral into a mental health (& domestic abuse) crisis if everyone is pounding beers in the morning. Just a thought.

2020-03-26 07:17:33
Absolutely agree. But I also feel the time will come, due to non-compliance, regardless who it is, where some kind of greater enforcement will be required, bcoz of a myriad converging issues: mixd msgs, apathy, defiance, as virus spreads & more die

(1/?) currently in self-isolation. Not because I have #COVID19  but because I share many similar symptoms of the virus. Dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, chest pains, etc. I understand that if you have these symptoms you should call 811. HOWEVER, when you call that... #COVIDalberta

Megan_Pierson13
2020-03-17 13:06:56
(3/?) so I call my doctor and she asks me some questions. She diagnose me as having the flu? And says I don’t need a #COVID19  test. Okay 1. I’ve had the flu, I know this isn’t the flu 2. How am I supposed to trust a diagnosis based over the phone?... #COVIDalberta

(4/?) Now I’m no doctor, but I must be honest and think this isn’t the best way to do this. Also since I do show similar symptoms to #COVID19  I must go into #SelfIsolation  for 2 weeks as instructed by my employer/company. #COVIDalberta

Precies dat. Continu tegen jezelf zeggen dat anderen het ook moeilijk hebben en er mensen zijn die het veel slechter hebben als jijzelf. Pfff, maar soms moet 't er gewoon even uit dat het gewoon ronduit kut is allemaal. Mijn depressies duikelen weer omhoog door dit gezeik en meh.

I agree. I get annoyed with people in my counties Facebook page upset cuz they’re on assistance and can’t qualify. As far as people in a new job situation, it’s not right. So if someone isn’t working now but filed taxes in 2018 a get a check? Didn’t they think of this?

Ben I ... think we’re researching precisely the same thing. Tho his name was Lawrence Joseph O’Hara, not Thomas? I’ve found three by-elections in 1919 (2 state, 1 federal) brought about by death of incumbents, but O’Hara’s seems only one identified as a result of ‘Spanish ‘flu’.

drcsalisbury
2020-03-18 05:46:58
There were two Paddington by-elections in 1919 but only the second because of member’s (O’Hara’s) death. Other state by-election I mentioned was Albany in WA where member died “after a long illness”. Also a federal by-election in Vic seat of Echuca after member died of pneumonia.
6
drcsalisbury
2020-03-18 06:15:14
Yes probably code, pneumonia was a commonly related cause of death. Newspaper reports I found in Trove just mentioned pneumonia or double pneumonia, none linked his death to influenza explicitly but still probable. Ten by-elections in 1919 all up, just those three death-related.

So... it’s illegal.  Use to be a lawyer.  Almost certain it’s illegal.  Your district can be sued if you implement this.  The lack of access and equity are one issue.  The lack of access for special education students is the big factor that makes this illegal.

Day 6. I've recovered from most of my symptoms, but developed a deep-seated hatred for the sort of profiteering cretins that are infesting modern society.

Thankfully, like inept thieves scribbling ransom notes on business cards, they're not discrete.

Can we make a self quarantine countdown? 14 days. With each day explaining what symptoms to look for. And you check in each day to verify that you are, indeed, at home and isolated.
Anyone wanna make it with me?

Same. My allergies are going nuts.
And yes it's social distancing. But that doesn't connote the right level of isolation needed. People still read it as "6+ feet from the next person"
I'm talking about stay at home, don't go out, kind of isolation.

No people panic buy then too, but different stuff.  The last thing people buy is too much food bc if we lose electricity or we have to evacuate. So shortages are batteries, gas, things like that.

BTW.  Most “smart” people get supplies once hurricane season starts so we aren’t panic buying.  Batteries, lanterns, fans I have from last year.  I just get cases of water early and keep then until I need them.

Hi there Rach, sending you a hug. 
I’m used to being alone too, and really don’t mind my own company. I live & travel alone, eat alone in restaurants etc - but that’s different, when there are strangers around for chatter when one feels the need, & of course online.

UK announces 47 deaths in the past 24 hours related to coronavirus. Total deaths now standing at 287.

The frightening thing is, the UK death rate is now rising at a faster rate than either Italy or China at the equivalent time

Father dearest came back over today, after I told him to stay in because he's at risk and I am very concerned. Seriously, if I have to go through self-isolation trauma I don't want him coming over here giving it to us because he goes out.

2020-03-27 00:55:39
I have endured childhood #trauma  that remains very vivid within me. I was isolated from everything & kept from the world, so #isolation  triggers me greatly. On some days I do okay but on others I struggle to make it hourly with so much panic racing thoughts and so forth.

He's not social distancing in fact he's being Mr. Goody helping his neighbors during the #COVID19  crisis. If I have to endure my trauma doing the right thing with isolation why should I have to worry he's bringing in the disease to me and my mother. He's risking our health.

And this is only being done because God forbid he loses control or insight on the pawns in his "game". It's not worth it, protection needs to be from everyone outside includes him. I've lectured him on his own safety. I care, I'm concerned, and I'm worried sick. Sick, I say.

Always have been & still am that kind of person that when told I can't do something I do it. My defiance was created in my childhood. I struggle with #agoraphobia  but the moment #COVID19  became a big thing here & we were told what *not* to do was when I yearned to go out.
7
Glass1ncision
2020-03-27 06:33:41
First, I found my purpose and I used that to justify being out. I wanted to help other people, connect them to resources, gathered supplies for them, etc. Now, I just can't justify it because going out poses a risk for my mother not just for myself. It I was alone I'd be out.

Omg I’m so sorry. 
I’ve been having symptoms since Monday. My doctor ( spoke to virtually) said I probably have it and I can’t get tested
A. Not enough kits
B. Don’t want to infect anyone else
C. I’m young and I should be fine
This system is terrible

Last Q (today  ): when you outlined in Nepal, and while writing now, is it all in your head of you write it down or use index cards, or another approach? I recall you saying Snake was outlined in a long drive, but did you write that outline down?

I want to ask if lots of coffee ALWAYS works 4 u with migraines, but I can’t get past the instant coffee tweet. Do you drink lots of instant coffee as migraine cure? Coz as much as I’d love ideas for managing migraines, I think I’d rather suffer if instant coffee is the medicine.

As much as I prefer we don’t leave the house unless in an emergency, the husband went into his office today to rescue his plants before they die. His office was obviously in a jungle, now transported to our living room. I kind of like it. #jungle  #covid19australia  #SelfIsolation pic.twitter.com/XMIC0uNUqX

When I experience any anxiety I think of the phrase you have used often “ worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do, but doesn’t get you anywhere” I don’t know if this will help anyone else, but it definitely helps me.

I suspect the reason Ramaphosa is not addressing us, is that he has been to the state hospital to take strong dosages cause he is the number one citizen it might cause serious panic if the news break out that he is infected. The above doesn't hold until proven other wise

So, there's a 50% chance that I'll get the #Coronavirus  and when I "win" that lottery, there's a 15-20% chance it's bad enough to require hospitalization AND a 1% chance it'll kill me? That math also tells me that between 1.5 and 2 million people in the US will die from #COVID19

Isa po ako na naka-self-quarantine ngayon. On March 3, pumunta ako sa St Luke’s Global City. Pinaunawa sa akin ni St Luke’s na hindi pa ako pwedeng ma-test dahil wala akong symptoms although galing ako sa ibang bansa. Hanggang ngayon, normal parin lahat kaya chill lang ako sa SQ.

2020-03-10 09:05:19
Isolated po ako sa pamilya ko. At syempre nauunawaan nila. St Luke’s explained to me what asymptomatic cases are. Kaya in an event na magka-fever, dysopnea/hypoxia, cough, muscle pain/fatigue ako, I can go directly to emergency room (dun isasagawa ang series of tests).

2020-03-10 10:05:31
Since test kits are limited, I opted not to induce them to test me. I believe many others who already have the symptoms need the kits more than I do. Siguro in times like this, kelangan natin maging altruistic in our approach. Same goes when buying masks, etc

I think for 2 weeks we can be very aggressive in what we shut down and then let stuff open again.....this list is letting maybe 80% of the population work and they are a lot of public facing jobs.  It is really a silly exercise at this point.
7
REMMER1551
2020-03-24 19:43:45
Yes but with the blowback that has already started - this will become a negative for him unless there are changes to the list.  I honestly think if they want to accomplish whet they stated then a 2 week hard close would be best.

REMMER1551
2020-03-24 20:19:31

OFTEN asked Q:
If it’s so bad why are hospital parking lots empty?
 Virus hasn’t spread east coast West coast inward yet
 Emergency response means: ZERO nonessential staff/visitors. ZERO nonessential elective procedures. 
 preparedness is VIP.

Real_EllieBrown
2020-03-30 03:22:10
Example: parking lot of my nursing home has been hugely silent 4 weeks. Normally NONSTOP activity. ALL activity is inside now. Instead, we have neighbors creating chalk art and waving at us inside. 
 Wouldn’t we rather extra precautions taking place in unhit areas? 
No panic. E

I bet there were massive aid cars in February - Kirkland WA. It’s the nursing homes & senior communities to watch. Rarely are ambulances coming to my place now like normal. We are taking care of COVID19 in-house— another thought, some people get worse very fast..

Real_EllieBrown
2020-03-30 05:57:24
Yes. Here is your reassurance: except for my residents on trial meds, the treatment for Covid19 is same as for our other isolation residents. It’s the breathing that you watch for. And you are likelier to rally faster at home than hospital right now.

I got so sick I almost died and I'm still also extremely worried about food and medicine. It took me two days to get the life-saving adrenaline and steroids that usually takes an hour to get because people with minor colds are panicking and I'm assuming demanding heavy medication

- us young and comprimised people are dying too
- old people are often disenfranchised and poor, and I'm sorry if your wealthy, conservative grandmother you wish death on is the only boomer you know, but I've quarantined myself to keep from killing the boomers in my life

I got incredibly sick. I thought this shit was going to kill me. I'm 23. And still I couldn't see a huge portion of the people I love most because I didn't want them to die. One boomer forcibly saw me while I was ill and I'm seriously concerned about what will happen.

Do not let your depression wish deaths on those you have not met. Do not let your depression assume we all want to die young. Face you fears and use your horns, but never do harm for the sake of pretending your view on death is healthy or universal

Also, do you know WHY old people seem to get grumpier and more conservative?

Because the poor and social ones die from shit like this. From visiting their seriously contagious grandson. From diseases they can't afford to treat. From poverty and lack of support.

Having a texting argument with my son. I am calling the Corona virus 'the plague' because it fits the definition

"a contagious disease that spreads rapidly and kills many people.plural noun: plagues"

He says it sounds archaic 

It is easier to say and type than corona virus

trump wishes death on the USA every day, like the moron that he is

He refuses to listen to the professionals who know what they are talking about, is putting the lives of millions of people at risk

He's insane,must be removed via the 25th Amendment while we still have a country

First #Québec  death. Elderly woman in seniors residence. Contracted #Covid19  from a visitor who had travelled. I hope that visitor feels guilty for the rest of his/her life. They knew better.
And so it starts.
It is not the virus that will kill us. It is ignorance and selfishness

Government: in case riots break out remember not to panic, stay indoors, and only worry about the essentials. Take care of your families and yourselves.

He got what he wanted, with no clear idea how to lead. His about face on the Herd Killing when opinion swung against him, is prime Johnson, he cannot lead, only follow.
  The panic in supermarkets, mirrors his own, &  his lack of leadership has damned many, needlessly.

Most patients can be confirmed with COVID19 within first 3 days, is very unlikely they will show symptoms after 14 days. China not only does the test kit but also takes a radiography of patient’s lungs. Therefore, you should be healthy in test and radiography to be released

You are confused. People get infected and may take til 27 days to show symptoms. Most will show symptoms within 3 days of infection, depends of the person and their inmune system. This case is more like ‘Thypoid Mary’, a person who will not show symptoms but can infect others

# coronavirus  After a month in isolation, some people are losing it. There are videos of people being tied up to a tree (Hubei) or pillar (Henan) because they don’t wear masks. Helen case a health worker yell at man ‘Do you want to live? Even if you don’t want to others want to’

Great discussion but this discussion doesn’t take into account special needs students who may not want to cancel but may have to cancel because of inability to provide accommodations

I was worried about it because I have asthma and my mom is a diabetic. Now I may have it but the dr said they’re rationing the test kits. He gave me a prescription for lidocaine pearls and told me to take Tylenol and stay indoors.

Current statistics in the United States show the highest number of hospitalizations for Corona Virus so far are for ages 20-55 ...
I would venture to guess because U.S. has higher numbers of health conditions in younger populations. A very real concern I haven't seen addressed.

Also, lots of evidence that you don't need to have symptoms to transmit. 

But definitely folks who are sick should *not* be in class. Even if it is "just" a cold. I would say something that gives anyone feeling unwell permission to leave rather than calling out individuals.

Indeed that is correct, in realistic terms it’s going to be a minimum of 12 weeks before we see if anything is working but the government dont want to state that as it’ll not go down to well with the public...it’s taken China 3 months to see a change, it’ll be the same in the UK.

8
N_iK0
2020-03-13 02:46:32
Because they are exhausting the resources of the CDC to hide cases and exposure, in hopes the people that are suffering and dying do it quitely and alone.  They are obsessed with covering up the fact the CDC left #COVID -19 unchecked for 6 weeks as the #WHO  warned of the epidemic.

If we carry on as normal have a guess how many will die? If we’d locked down from the start 0.5-0.9%  death rate, we are now in the 1-3% death rate of those infected. You do the sums
8
bewar3them00n
2020-03-21 16:28:13
Covid-19 cases 3,973
Deaths 177
By my calculations that’s a 4.4% mortality rate.
This is at rate predicted if action was not taken soon enough.
If Boris had implemented immediate shut down, we’d be at the <1% rate.
This Government is the most inept in living memory.

So have you all seen the news story yet where some people with covid19 present only with a lack of sense of smell?

It occurred to me this morning that while neither my husband nor I have lost our sense of smell, something is off.

Sibling: yeah, remember the last week you were here [the week before I was symptomatic] nothing tasted to smelled right to you?

Me: vaaaaaguely

Sibling: you thought my ramen smelled like TUNA

me: OH MOTHERFLERKIN I REMEMBER THAT

So I am super upset to realize that I have probably exposed my 70+ parents and immunocompromised sibling to what is probably covid19.  On the upside, it’s 11 days since I was there last and none of them are symptomatic yet so hopefully I didn’t breathe on any of them too much.

Spouse and I started showing symptoms (MILD) within 2 days of each other, so we’re taking care of each other.

(But when I say mild? Really, it’s more annoying than worrisome. Neither of us had fever go over 100°, and it’s been about a week now. I’m just glad we’re at home.)

New York’s governor Andrew Cuomo was warned 2 years ago about his state’s shortage of ventilators.

He had the chance to order 16,000 of them but turned it down citing they were “too expensive“.

It's not speculation if it's accurate information. When they do daily updates and reveal however many preliminary cases they could easily also say "and 45 cases awaiting results" for example. What does providing more information have to hurt? Im just asking for accurate info.

Zero new cases gives the impression that there are no new cases in the province within that 24hr period when that isnt an accurate number for that day because there are many patients awaiting results who could be postive. Giving both numbers is accurate information.

Dear Me,

The darkness you see all around you, the fear that tugs at your heart, and the painful torment in your spirit; these things are not you. These things are lies! You’re not crazy, you’re not a bad or toxic person, you’re not even abnormal.
9
MarzyMartian
2020-03-08 02:57:21
The stress you endure on a daily basis is from the situations you allow to fester in your spirit. Do not let these things overtake who you really are. Someday, you will look back on these days; will you be proud, or full of regret? The choice is yours alone.
9
MarzyMartian
2020-03-08 02:57:22
Be the person you look up to. Set an example for yourself every day, and strive to be that person. Don’t stay idle with your thoughts for too long, and remember that the bad times won’t last forever. You’re not perfect, you’re not a robot. You have feelings, emotions, heart.
9
MarzyMartian
2020-03-08 02:57:22
Lastly, if anyone else is reading this and you’ve been feeling this way, too... it’s okay to feel it out. Be mad, cry, laugh, scream... but don’t hurt yourself in the process. And remember that your health matters.

My anxiety has taken a turn. Hubs went to grocery store today. I made him put bags in garage, rush upstairs to dispose of clothes and shower, while I took Clorox wipes to every single bag/package then washed all the fresh veggies/fruit. I feel like I’ve lost it #anxiety  #struggle

I'm sick and tested negative for the flu. Even though I have all of the symptoms of #COVIDー19 , I did not qualify for testing because I'm not elderly and don't have underlying health problems. I was told to assume i have it and self quarantine. Not enough tests for everyone

Finally went to the Dr yesterday.  Negative for flu. Not enough tests for me to be tested so I'm quarantined and was told to just assume i have it. Work finally approved me to work from home,  so that's a huge relief!  Hope everyone there is safe and healthy still.

Unfortunately people like you tend to be asymptomatic carriers, meaning you can be spreading the disease to others for weeks and never know you have it. It's why people that "don't get the flu" are still told to get a flu shot.

Polls mean nothing. If you have 100 people and you ask 10 if their favorite color is blue and 5 of them say yes, does that mean that 50 out of the 100 have blue as their favorite color? No, of course it doesn't. 1000 out of 340 million? That's not even 1%.

2. We’re in our 60s.

# COVID19  So we all panic, start evacuating people, then eventually most countries will have an outbreak (not particularly related to repatriation), and then what? Could we focused more in disease control measures at local level and enhance basic health within our borders? https:// twitter.com/Reuters/status /1231936991819857920   …

1,777 x 5% = 89 serious or critical cases

I know subconsciously when I worry more, I lick my lips a lot more. They are now very dry and itchy  . I've just rubbed in our Minty lip balm and wow, feeling instantly relieved

Learn conjunctions
(and, if, so, until, while, but, or, for, etc...)

Then...
Learn these 10 verbs and their common forms in 10 days
(Have, Be, Go/Come, Make/Do, Open, Close, Live, Die, Speak/Say, Know).

If a dem president
- turned down WHO test kits
- publicly called COVID a hoax for weeks
- fired entire pandemic response team 2 years ago
- publicly recos unproven drug combo
...EVERY AMERICAN would disapprove of how the crisis has been managed. Blows my mind people defend this.

# SelfQuarantine  Day 10 thought
Somehow, STILL, I keep seeing people say that "#Covid_19  isn't that bad. It's like a bad flu! Only 10% of people who get it need to be hospitalized and only 1% die!"

1st I'm not sure those numbers are correct but let's assume they are
10
anRCTIDrew
2020-03-22 04:46:46
So what does this mean?
If only 10% of Americans get the virus, and only 10% of them require hospitalization, and 10% of THOSE die then this virus will kill approximately 300,000 Americans.
10
anRCTIDrew
2020-03-22 04:46:46
300,000 is over half the population of Wyoming.

Its more than all US combat deaths in WW2 (or any other single conflict in US history)

It's about half of all US combat deaths from 1776 through today combined.

It would become the 3rd leading cause of Death in the US.
10
anRCTIDrew
2020-03-22 04:46:46
Behind only Cancer and heart disease.

It's 10x the number of people who died from the flu last year (despite a similar number of cases ~35M)

The biggest factor is going to be how long does it take to get to 30 million cases?
10
anRCTIDrew
2020-03-22 04:46:47
If those 3 million cases happen relatively quickly then the hospitals will be overwhelmed. The fatality rate will skyrocket (as is happening in Italy where it's now over 8%) those 10% that need the hospital will die without it.
10
anRCTIDrew
2020-03-22 04:46:47
And remember, this is if only 10% of Americans get it. This is an OPTIMISTIC outlook.

If that number goes up to even 15% that's another 1.5 million people in the hospital (1.5x Total capacity), another 150,000 (or more if hospitals get overwhelmed) dead.
10
anRCTIDrew

How about we get it under control first THEN worry about who to blame? https:// twitter.com/thedailybeast/ status/1241440662140190720   …

2020-03-23 03:03:18
Do you want millions of people to die?
10
anRCTIDrew
2020-03-23 03:05:53
Total US death rate right now is 1.3%
(flu is 0.1%) New York has a death rate of about 16% and if you include all the negative tests, not just confirmed positives, as well it drops all the way to 4%

The law permits only least restrictive means, e.g. limited geographic quarantine. WAC 246-100-045

You already shut down entire industries & ordered social distancing for a period of time equal to the usual incubation period of Covid-19, as per WAC 246-100-011(26).

Agreed. But it's not handling the situation. Handling it would imply we all get tested and quarantine those who need it, and have the proper equipment for those who need it.
There are no tests — there's just people staying home terrified and unsure if they're exposed or sick

I never said all. But when someone has symptoms, they should be tested. The WHO was willing to give us tests and Trump turned them away.
People who show any symptoms should have been tested weeks ago — and then we wouldn't need 360m tests now.

Day 1: Place your empty jar on your kitchen scale and zero it out. Then add 50g of lukewarm water and 50g of flour. Mix with a clean spoon or clean hands. 

If you don’t have a scale, measurements are roughly 3Tblsp water and 6 Tblsp flour. (Cont’d)

All in all things are deeply sad & scary, w/ that my #depression  has increased. I've slept the entire day all most, claiming that 'ah I'm just not feeling well'... It's not sickness, it's depression & it has me in its grasp & squeezing so ever tightly. I cannot escape.

Just secured some time by myself, solo late night "me time". I look forward to this every night maybe tonight more than others. Just want to be alone, my own company, my own quiet time. Watching Ozark on #Netflix . Sad about the state of this world as a whole.

House votes Friday and I believe either your 2018 or 2019 tax info is used. Nothing has changed for us in that time, but we haven’t filed for 2019 yet. I’m assuming since we filed jointly that they will use the account on file.

His lack of education is astounding in general given the schools he “graduated” from, but for a US president it’s almost comical. It’s it wasn’t so incredibly sad, I’d be laughing. I genuinely fear for our safety right now with talks of trying to have churches open Easter.

Hey, friend: I've seen you mention depression, so heads up if you're on antidepressants or anxiety meds, OTCs like Benadryl, NyQuil or DayQuil negatively interact with one of mine, making me feel extra anxious/weird. May not be all, but perhaps ask pharm first.   Love & light!

Then the advantage to this slow rise is that the hospitals don't become overburdened, so death rates are kept lower as a result.  We know people are not being tested here, even if close contact.  I wonder how true death rate is or do we have a lot of pneumonia deaths this year?

Wait, Rand Paul’s in isolation? Gee, sure would be a REAL shame if he ended up drowning in his own blood and bodily fluids. I mean, this nation would never be the same without such a VITAL contribution to our democracy!

Can't have it confirmed because my symptoms don't meet the level of hospitalization. But fever, dry cough, headache, body aches and fatigue. It's similar in symptoms to other things so it's impossible to tell for sure right now. But the cough specifically is worse than any other.

Lori, at last count, the USconducted about 1m tests, only 10-12% positive. also, the cold and flu's are still around, this could be nothing more than that. Also, don't forget, even if it is Covid19, in China 82,000 people had it confirmed, over 75,000 of them have recovered

5. Know the numbers. Check credible and reliable sources for numbers. Don’t put stock into your fear, but rather know that the number of active cases is smaller than the number of confirmed cases. Stay alert, not anxious.

2020-03-10 12:40:12
6. Stay home if you feel any type of symptoms. From the lowest grade fever, to the “maybe it’s just allergies” sniffles, the best thing you can do is stay home. Drink plenty of fluids, stay warm, and get as much rest as possible. Read some books, watch some movies. Stay home!

7. Make a plan. Call your doctor, and any other specialists you may have, to find out what their protocols are. Call local health facilities to find out their plans, as well. It’s better to be prepared than to be frantic in an urgent moment. Stay calm! Write it all down.

To be fair: this medication isn’t necessarily a cure. But, from what we have seen, it appears 2 blunt symptoms but doesn’t necessarily shorten shedding process (contagious). It appears to hold some patients back from ARD which is the deadliest end stage. (Per my med directors). E

The crucial thing is that the hospitals here in Japan don't seem to be overwhelmed.  It is a mystery to everyone how we have so few cases but something we should be thankful for.  Cruise ships were banned immediately after DP.

Still not overwhelmed. In most countries, you don't get tested unless you have strong symptoms, to avoid rush on hospitals.  The 4 days wait would still indicate that there'd be a rush if those symptoms became serious.  They could test more here, but same true elsewhere.

We had two stores set to open about now/in the last month.
We’re having to absorb those people and train them but also not expand our labor budget somehow? And also hire more people. But the spike in our sales my go down...
Trying to compartmentalize. I just have to do today.

Isolate if you’re sick.

Self Quarantine, Day 12: Make up companies need to make self-tanner in a range of colours. I'd use a self-tanner if they were tinted, so I could be fully blue, purple, green or whatever. Just the orange Oompa-Loompa look - doesn't do a thing for me.

Have you ever told someone a goal / dream of yours & how did they react ? Where they super excited for you, happy ? Want to help push you in the right direction so you can achieve it ? Or they said, nothing, laughed or torn you down? Pick your circle wisely!

Pets of the Pandemic      

Here are some true stories illustrated The Guardian of how animals are 'helping' in self-isolation. They made us chuckle. We had to share our favourites.

How have your pets been 'helping'?

Each country is struggling to keep people alive and the economy alive at the same time. Once evidence shows the numbers start to spike, they take action and ask ppl to stay at home. Then if things don’t improve they have no other choice but to shut the country down.
13

2020-03-25 15:40:35
This symptom alone may not have been enough to get a test here, so there’s a difference in testing if you look at what’s considered a symptom according to different countries. 2/
13
OonaMcGee
2020-03-25 15:40:51
However, we have to take other things into account and look at the bigger picture when discussing testing too, because in Japan, if you have flu symptoms you go to the ENT, do the unpleasant swab test and find out if you have flu strain A or B. This is unheard of in Australia. 3/
13
OonaMcGee
2020-03-25 15:41:38
In Australia you just take a week or so off work and go home and rest. 
They’re already very vigilant with flu testing in Japan compared to a lot of other countries, and often classes are shut when more than a few kids in one class come down with the flu. 4/

I'm not naming names, depts, colleges, programs or years. I'm in no mood to dredge up the sordid details.

I do hope that those who are seeing their academic dreams and hopes taking shape today with admission don't suffer any of the heartbreaking dismay and trauma I experienced

Hence the qualifier "confirmed".

Confirmed cases give us a window on what's happening in any one area. And, importantly, an idea of whether or not the number of sickest people is going up or down.

Some data > no data.

And "some data" =/= totally wrong, useless data.

Stay at home doesn't mean quarantine in isolation 24/7. It just means eliminate unnecessary interactions and do as much as you can from home. So you can still go out shopping, or for a walk etc, so long as you keep your distance from others.

The swab is much less invasive than people are reporting. What Eman tweeted here is accurate (I had the test last Thursday).

It was a teeny tiny bit uncomfortable but that’s about it.

Success! She’s walking on that foot! She’s been hobbling around with a broken claw, snapped down to her pad; too painful to put weight down with that dangling claw aggravating the injury. #dog  #claw  #injury pic.twitter.com/22bppoPNAX

Attempted our first walk in days since broken claw. Started out alright, but few mins in, she’s limping then wanted me to hold her. Set her down couple more times, she'd only take few steps then wants to be picked up. Her foot is too sore. Good progress though #dog  #dogwalk     https:// twitter.com/FalconSays/sta tus/1245831267330875393   … pic.twitter.com/0r1FmK59sX

Add tomato and garlic, continue to cook veggies down. Add salt and pepper/paprika again to taste. The salt will help release the water out of the vegetables as they’re being cooked. Ensure the veggies are thoroughly cooked but not burnt, cook at a slow pace.

Most countries have tested only people with symptoms (such as fever, cough, which mark the time of viremia) after a possible contact, or people in contact with an individual who tested positive and was displaying symptoms. These rules are being followed in #Okinawa ,  2/3

Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 – but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent

Dear administrators, let go of the existing structures.  If your school didn’t provide a laptop, WiFi, and accommodations for special education students then you can’t expect or penalize for lack of attendance 

Attendance was already plagued with inequity before this https:// twitter.com/nicholasferron i/status/1243600210582016002   …

outlined provisions for attendance arent equitable in these circumstances

Not going to convince me that attendance doesn’t skew towards those with transportation or isn’t centered in ableism especially when a friend had to fight a truancy battle while being treated for cancer

We are limited by #SARSCoV2  testing in the US. 

Given this reality, let's follow the logical response. 

Mild symptoms & don't need to go to the hospital? Testing doesn't change any actions--be responsible and selfQ, tell your contacts.

I believe based on the testimony and actions of the disciples that were with Jesus before and after the resurrection.

They saw the torture and abuse Jesus and His followers had to endure, yet after the resurrection they chose to double down and accept that inevitable torture.

Here's my answer. If someone claimed to die, be buried and rise again 3 days later I wouldn't believe it unless I personally knew the person before and saw them in the flesh after.

I believe people are "revived" all the time, but only 1 person will ever rise from the dead.

Window seat is a similar concern but you need to lean towards the window the whole time to avoid cuddling with the middle seat. https:// twitter.com/ImFatPod/statu s/1245002975858352128   …

Instead, if one or two million people die, that would fix the economic troubles in a heartbeat, right?

Since most of the idiots who are not self-quarantining are republicans,my family & friends will not die: yours will

Point is, (and don't want to be a Debbie Downer) - I don't see this spread slowing down or coming to a halt. I'm no health expert, but the reason why we buy groceries in bulk to last weeks for a quarantine, is because .... drumroll .. it's supposed to be a quarantine!

Also, let’s add this: I have continuously asked @AP_Trevor  what is happening with special education students accomodations

Despite having detailed plans and responses for everything else, he told me “per usual” they would provide accommodations. I asked for details, nothing

2020-03-29 23:38:48
So for disabilities, it all depends on the disability.  For me with ADHD, anxiety, and a visual tracking issue, this AP open note format would depend on where my ADHD was that day and what accommodations are being offered.
15
jennthetutor
2020-03-29 23:42:27
A concern is accommodations aren’t being provided for the AP free prep.For example,there is no captions for the prep material & no interpretation for students

just proves to me that students with disabilities weren’t considered if this basic accessibility issue wasn’t thought of pic.twitter.com/6QJyn2lX17

I’ve kind of always seen this as one of the caveats of owning a business. High risk/high reward so to speak. If you’re on the up, you take a £20k dividend but if not you get nothing. It’s the risk you take in running your own business, especially as a Ltd company of 1.

I’m no scientist or doctor, but if you’re most contagious BEFORE you show symptoms, how is this helping the prevention of community spread? In addition, what’s to say someone won’t pop a couple Tylenol’s and be symptoms free by the time they get to the train station?!

My 7-hour flu is almost over for the day. (don't worry; it happens every day & better the next day until 4pm--part of my pre-existing condition). My head didn't hurt as much today.   Now that things are a little calmer, I might #sleep  now. Bonne nuit! #GoodNightTwitterWorld pic.twitter.com/2n2OJRAsfX

I just went for a walk with a bandana on my face. It feels silly also alerts people to give me at least 6ft of space. Everyone was distancing appropriately, no one else had face protection. I think it can't hurt but isn't necessary. And obvi not sole reason for dif in curves

Things have turned nicely, feeling good about the day; both mentally and physically. The hours long panic attack has faded to black, as if it didn't happen, didn't disrupt morning for me. Sometime it is little things that really make a difference. Family & springtime.

With a sunset so beautiful in a Spring sky so blue it's so difficult to comprehend that mid-March the world turned upside down, a pandemic bloomed and we became living history in a textbook written once we're gone. A fight against an invisible war. #TogetherAtHome pic.twitter.com/noBifiDweD

Time has changed, feelings have changed, and as of late this has become my preferred #time . About 8:30-9pm, I feel embraced tightly in the darkness. Hugged tightly. It's the only time I feel I can let my guard down, that I'm not on edge. That I can pretend everything is okay.

It's intense for me once mum's asleep & I'm only up. I reflected on it yesterday when I realized how my feelings have changed. Never have been one to seek out comfort of embrace, I am now. Nestled under my covers in my new mid-day nap, tight & snug is another one.

What I have discovered about my husband after 3 weeks of isolation: he is possessive about his laundry basket. Evidently, he is able to identify which of 3 identical baskets is his. I somehow took his basket. For days, he has harped on this terrible betrayal.

Add water, an onion and let it simmer. Strain and put in freezer bags or containers to freeze and make wonderful soups later.

Pre-2016, this made sense. 

In the brutal reality that is #America2020 , when it comes down to Weimar Republic vs. demented Hitler in a blonde wig and a hankering for genocide, Weimar Republic it is.

We can come back from the Weimar Republic.
Demented Hitler will end us all. https:// twitter.com/Manleyan_Lulis t/status/1244324478995193856   …

This is on trump 100%. So many Americans will die because we installed an utterly incompetent, hideously demented POTUS.

When I and others warned in 2016 that people will die if we hand trump the WH, this is what we meant.

The final toll will be staggering.

Because all of them took their oaths of office seriously and in a crisis did what they could to save lives. They all made missteps and mistakes and they have regrets.

But none of them is or was a murderous sociopath who would just as soon let as all die if it helps his ratings.

Masks can be easily sewn from old t-shirts and cost nothing to make except a little time. You can even do it by hand.

They can be washed or disinfected after each use.

Amazon has had no delivery slots for over 2+wks, not Fresh, Pantry, or Whole Foods. Nothing. 

So I started using other, smaller, local delivery services, and  http:// yummy.com    came out the winner for my grocery delivery dollars. Highly recommend. https:// twitter.com/aaron_con_choc o/status/1244633449454899201   …

They withheld information & supplies.

They focused on making money off the suffering & death of our loved ones.

Their policies are death sentences.

That sounds like a more severe case. I was actively sick, but I wouldn’t say drastically sick, for say 12 days. Only really aggressively sick for about 4-5 days in the middle. But it’s definitely felt like a case of mono on either side of that. I’m on day... 14? now. Less tired!

You shouldn't worry. In those type situations you need to numb yourself to it, or you will go insane, or get super depressed. It won't last long after, when things get better. You will still feel emotions, you may have to remind yourself that it's okay to do so.

I ended up reading and writing. And turning into a cat because all I did was look outside the window even though nothing happens in our court. It was harder than I thought at first and I felt really sad but it actually showed me after a while that I'm totally okay without it all.

My uncle is in the hospital due to a medical condition that’s shutting his kidneys down. They also found a perforation in his colon and had to do surgery. They don’t think he’s going to make it. And my mom and her sisters aren’t allowed to go say goodbye.

Nothing comes into my home without being cleaned first. Husband comes home from job (he’s essential) and strips down at the entry, takes his clothes to the washer, and heads straight for the shower. Not risking anything! But now we are getting low on wipes and sanitizer

I know 6.6M people filed for unemployment and it’s awful. But over 1000 people in the US died yesterday. And 1000 will die today. The tragedy is not the end of capital, it’s end of life.

Capital as in financial capital. So unemployment is a loss of capital. 

On the second point, true. But if we treated this as a wartime moment, we would ensure health coverage for all (social safety net).

I've researched this most experts seem to agree that it's fine, but best to wash hands before you eat. If hard plastic containers, you can wipe them down and/or transfer the food onto plates. It is nerve-wracking for sure, but so worth it for you and for local businesses.

@ gumdrop92 : Let's not make assumptions, rather show some compassion. Being alone isn't a negative, but being alone w/o physical human connection for 18 days like I've been CAN get lonely & impact one mentally since it's out of our normal routine or needs. Our feelings are valid.

More restrictive & law enforcement can get involved if not followed. Ex.: Some employers still don't have ppl working from home & many parks still open. Varies by city/state.

You assumed she hadn't. That's my point. You just responded thinking she hates being alone in general w/o knowing any other information. I err on the side of compassion rather than shaming. Right now, let's just share love for each other's situations, emotions & experiences.

2020-04-01 20:17:27

ISeeSkies0fBlue
2020-04-01 20:38:28
Not to mention, many ppl who like being alone don't love themselves, keeping away from friendships, other relationships, or connecting w/ others out of fear or insecurity. So, remember, situations don't automatically = one thing. Just, listen & love if you don't know details.

If someone needs to go to the store or get to work- that’s not even the issue here. The issue is that people are still gathering in large groups for unnecessary reasons, and endangering the lives of others. And for that reason alone I believe heavy fines should be put in place.

2. The dollar is the commonly used currency. So many countries are borrowing dollars from the world bank. This increase the dollar in circulation thus its gonna strengthen against weak currencies, that don't control their central banks to ensure stability & liquidity

BE KIND. Especially to those essential employees & customer service - they’re going thru this, too. Imagine if someone started screaming & cursing at you right now & how you’d feel. It’s not ok on a normal day, let alone now - knock it off.

It was. Doing OK. Symptoms were mild. Was a backdoor way to get wife tested since she had come home with cough, fever, shortness of breath and easily fatigued a couple weeks ago.

Was low key hoping it was positive since it was so mild for us because then we'd know.

A lot of people need to go outside to stay sane. Even those that don't suffer from PTSD and depression. Staying in a small flat with few rooms and no garden will destroy a lot of people. Suicide and domestic violence will kill more people than this virus.

Poor excuse for anyone. Yup a whole 3 days (they missed the form 10 & to tell me he was released) then Peacebond 1 year. No contact, no weapons/drinking ect. I reported everything since all was broken repeatedly, nothing was done. PO's hands tied cuz it would violate his rights.

Thank you! It's  intimidating putting out there a very dark part of your life that isn't in the "past" but very current even though it started years ago. 

Honestly I'd rather it be happening to me cuz I will fight back & now won't be silent. Abuse can be a #SilentKiller  too

No apologies needed beautiful, it's a lot to take in and thank you. Living in #fear  & not in love is not a way anyone should live

The UFC had just launched Fight Pass and they were in the process of uploading every fight they had broadcast rights to onto the platform to stream. Basically rendering the production of event DVDs unnecessary. Granted these PRIDE DVDs were made years prior. #MMATwitter

You don’t risk people’s lives to follow the law.  Criminal negligence that leads to death is also a violation of the law bud.  If you have to choose keeping people alive you do that first then find a legal way for them to function

So we are suppose to be cool with ell and special education students not being educated because something is better than nothing... that’s the new equity 

If a school opened up and didn’t take those students we’d riot but right now it’s happening but it’s all good

2020-04-03 08:20:56
Like I said earlier today, something is better than nothing is the diet separate but equal 

You shouldn’t proceed with ANY plan unless it’s inclusive.  Proceeding without whole groups just tells us you all think it’s okay to ignore the plaguing inequities.

No.  Some rural students aren’t receiving education.  Some special education and ELL students aren’t receiving education or services

The lack PPE equipment for the NHS.
The shortage of ventilators.

We as a people gotta stop relying on polls. They surveyed 1000 people. There are about 350 million people in the US. So, no...it's not "55% of Americans"...it's 55% of the 0.0005 percent of the population that was surveyed. Polls mean nothing. They vaguely suggest possible trends

PS. Healthcare staff, inc. students, are routinely told to keep their social media accounts as unidentifiable as possible because the media in particular LOVE dragging us through the dirt. So yeah, I'm anonymous because I'm worried about the repercussions of sharing my opinion.

Despite all that he does with single minded concentration for the nation something that is unparalleled in history. One after the other he's dealing with India's core issues and now this corona.I feel that I were in his shoes I'd be terrified at the daunting problem we are facing

The type of pain does not matter; the important thing is that the pain experienced is unpleasant. Because anger never occurs in isolation but rather is necessarily preceded by painful feelings, it is often characterized as a ''secondhand'' emotion.

Anecdotal.

There are also the teens who died in emergency rooms and/or those who were 100% healthy, then dead of covid-19 in a week.

It is hugely irresponsible to minimize risk to *anyone* in a country that is hardly testing at all, with a POTUS who does nothing but lie.

Even a slight fever can dehydrate you

A cool bath with baking soda may help relax you, bring a fever down a little

If it gets bad, call 911, tell them you just need someone to check your fever, they may be willing to do that

However, #gun  violence is up: 10,546 people dead from guns so far this year. In fact, #Covid  only overtook that number a day or two ago. in the last 72 hrs alone: 107 dead, 197 injured up from half this number 2 weeks ago.
Gun sales soaring...

More salt and more water. 

When it happens, pull your toes firmly up towards your knees. It'll hurt but it'll extend the tight muscles.

Massage your foot hard to loosen the muscles. A hard ball (tennis ball would do) or a solid tube (can of hairspray) can help.
